    "### Machine Learning using NLP of Wine Descriptions\n",
    "**Goal:** perform NLP on wine descriptions (using TF-IDF). Use the TF-IDF scores, along with other wine info, to build a machine learning algorithm that can predict the rating score for wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  A csv file of reviews with descripitons, varietals, region, and score from Wine Enthusiast Magazine. CSV was obtained from use zackthoutt on kaggle.com: [wine review data](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). This dataset is 150,000 wine reviews, and only includes wines with scores from 80-100. The dataset has been cleaned to include only those reviews that include price (many had no listed price.) The cleaned dataset contains approximately 120,000 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:** A machine learnign algorithm that can take in:\n",
    "1. Wine description (textual)\n",
    "2. Country of origin\n",
    "3. Designation (optional) - this is more specific data about the wine\n",
    "4. Price\n",
    "5. Province (optional)\n",
    "6. Region\n",
    "7. Varietal\n",
    "8. Winery\n",
    "\n",
    "**The algorithm should then output a score (from 80-100).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we will create an algorithm that will attempt to predict score from *only* the text description, and will then compare this to an ML algorithm including text data in addition to the other wine data."

       " \"Coronato is a robust, modern super Tuscan only produced for export markets. Indeed, you can sense a New World appeal within its rich, succulent fabric thanks to penetrating notes of coffee, espresso, tar, aniseed, chocolate and bursting cherry. It's soft and velvety with enormous charm.\",\n",
       " \"This isn't the most powerful, impressive Pinot Noir from the Sonoma Coast, but it has a lot going for it. It's bone dry, crisply acidic and elegant on the palate, with a flavor of sour cherry candy that's savory and clean. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Alluring aromas of cocoa powder, berry fruits, graphite and raw oak lead to a jammy palate with density and weight. This old-vines Monastrell tastes of chocolaty oak and herbal blackberry. On the finish, it's tight and rugged, with mildly scratchy tannins and a saucy aftertaste. Drink through 2022.\",\n",
       " 'For the vintage, this is a surprisingly lean wine. Some juicy fruit is still struggling out of the very dry tannic shell. Acidity is a dominant character of this firm, dry wine.',\n",
       " 'Smoke, spice and earth notes mark this deeply mineral auslese, adding depth and complexity to the sunny palate and peach and apricot flavors. A beautifully executed calibration of savory and sweet, it finishes with a twang of struck steel and lime.',\n",
       " \"Firmer and more tannic than many Hawke's Bay Syrahs, this is nonetheless classy, with gentle cracked-pepper notes and ripe blueberries upfront, followed by layers of blackberries, black olives and spice. The lingering finish features bright berries underscored by coffee grounds. Drink 2018–2025.\",\n",
       " 'A sweet style of aged tawny, it has rich caramel flavors that combine with sultanas and almonds to give a ripe and generous wine. It has kept plenty of fresh fruitiness while moving towards wood aging.',\n",
       " \"Opulent and elegant, this brilliant deep-gold Tokaji has aromas of vanilla caramel, crème brûlée and candied apricot. On the palate, crisp acidity clears the path for flavors of preserved apricot and candied apple. It's full and round in the mouth, and delightful on its own or served with cheese.\",\n",
       " 'With too much smoky toast, this gives a hard, extracted feel with licorice rather than fruit. Tannins are dense and hints of juicy fruitiness only appear in the background.',\n",
       " \"Very dry, tart and brittle, this Pinot, from a famous old vineyard that pioneered the Napa side of Carneros, isn't very lush right now. The cherryskin flavors are more bitter and tannic than you expect from most Pinot Noirs. Really needs lamb, steak or similar rich fare to wake it up.\",\n",
       " 'A good Merlot that shows a fine structure, without much complexity. The wine is dry and tannic and soft, with blackberry, black cherry, plum and oak flavors. Ready now.',\n",

       " \"In keeping with the dry style that marks Jeaunaux-Robin Champagne, this is a taut, crisply fruity wine. It has light, bright fruits with a touch of more mature toast and cookie flavors. It's just ready to drink.\",\n",
       " 'Spicy Asian pear dominates in this low-to-no-oak white, medium-bodied and jumping in savory thyme. Aromas of peaches also come into play, before this wine finishes crisp and clean.',\n",
       " \"This basic Cabernet opens with standard berry, plum and herbal aromas. It's racy and tight on the tongue, with a mix of berry, chocolate and minty green flavors. The finish is spicy but not very fruity or complex. This is good as a pizza wine.\",\n",
       " 'Extremely thick, soft and extracted, this delivers flavors of ripe fruit, cinnamon stick, honey, barbecue sauce, cured meat and dried apple skin. Savory tones of leather and button mushroom show up later.',\n",

       " \"It is rare to find Tinta Barroca on its own. Normally it is used for blending in Port. Here, though, it is in all its ripe fruit glory, an attractive, relatively lightweight wine. It's for drinking now, with red berry fruits right to the fore.\",\n",
       " 'A powerful, almost overbearing oak influence makes this wine bombastic. Toasty, maple sugar and smoked bacon flavors come from heavily charred new oak barrels or oak add-ins. It has a very dark color, full body, plenty of tannins and a smoky, oaky finish.',\n",
       " 'Herbal, leathery aromas are horsey and sharp. This feels rugged and choppy, then tastes baked and herbal, like a mix of stewed fruits, oregano, cured meat and pepper. A grassy, herbal finish does little to bring it around.',\n",

       " 'Soft and creamily fruity, this is an attractive, fresh wine. It has citrus fruit and apple-skin flavors and crisp, clean acidity. For drinking over the next year.',\n",
       " 'A very structured, firm wine with excellent acidity and dark, dry tannins. The alcohol does show through, but the wine is firm and very dense, a big success from this Lurton family owned property.',\n",
       " \"With 15.4% alcohol by volume, this is arguably Lail's ripest, hottest Cabernet ever. It certainly has flashy blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with plenty of toasty oak, but there's a raisin-and-prune, overripe finish. Could age, but it's more likely that the heat will pinch in within six years, crushing the fruit.\",\n",
       " 'A generous, smooth texture and nicely bright flavors of lemon, lime and apple make this a satisfying wine. It is medium to full bodied, soft in acidity, but fresh in flavor. It should be a winner for large groups.',\n",
       " \"This opens with earthy underbrush, violet and red berry aromas. The palate is bright, with tart red cherry and ripe raspberry accented by notes of pepper and baking spice. It's vibrant and calls out for hearty pastas or pecorino cheese.\",\n",
       " 'Sweet new wood goes with rich plum skins in a wine that has a firm structure. The richness of the wine revolves around sweet cherries and juicy acidity. With the wood still dominant, it needs at least five years to settle down.',\n",
       " 'The gorgeously opaque ruby color raises high hopes. However, the undistinguished, earthy nose fails to deliver. The lush palate is a step up, with red berry soup flavors interwoven with an odd ashy note. Long finish. Drink up.',\n",

The mouthfeel is like crushed velvet, with a creamy texture and a decadent finish reminiscent of chocolate-covered espresso beans.',\n",
       " 'An honest and very ripe take on Australian Chardonnay, with opulent notes of fig, pineapple and guava underscored by crisp lemon and a faint spritz that refresh the palate. The short-to-medium finish turns a bit soft. Quite likable on the whole. Try with lobster.',\n",
       " \"For an entry level wine, this is impressive, offering hints of grapefruit pith, bergamot and smoke on the nose and following those up with some meaty-mushroomy notes on the palate. It's not typical, but boasts a silky texture and a unqieu combination of citrus and umami that lingers nicely on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"Negociant Cameron Hughes got his hands on some seriously good Cabernet to come out with this beauty. It's soft enough to drink right away, with luxurious tannins framing ripe, sweet flavors of blackberries, cherries and licorice. Sweet oak gives a rich layer of toast. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones.

       " 'This new cuvée is 60% Malbec, 35% Syrah and the rest Merlot. It seems to have been given extra barrel time, and the overpowering and heavy toast scents and flavors dominate. The raspberry fruit flavors are somewhat buried as a result, and the wine seems over-matched. But more bottle age may help to open it up.',\n",

       " \"J has taken the unusual step of blending Pinot Noir with Pinot Meunier, which is not so strange, but also with Pinotage, which is practically unheard of. The addition of the latter certainly makes the wine darker, heavier and more tannic than it ordinarily would be. It also brings an earthiness to Pinot's vibrant cherries. It's an oddball, but a charming one to drink with rich winter stews.\",\n",
       " 'Simple and jammy, although tasty enough, with lip-smacking, candied flavors of cherries, raspberries and spicy mocha. Feels light and silky in the mouth, with gentle acids and tannins.',\n",
       " 'Rich and thick, this full-bodied, ripely bold wine has small amounts of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Mocha chocolate meets blackberry jam washed down in fresh-brewed coffee, making for a memorable experience.',\n",

       " 'The best of the 2009 lineup from Willamette Valley Vineyards, this Eola-Amity Hills single-vineyard offering has the most complexity, in both nose and mouthfeel. Balanced fruits fill the palate, with spicy hints of earth, leaf and a wash of barrel-induced mocha.',\n",
       " 'Dusty smelling and a touch dilute on the nose, this Viura-Chardonnay blend displays aromas of green apple, citrus and vanilla. The palate is juicy, citric and clean, with tangerine, lemon peel and white grapefruit flavors. This is an ideal quaffing wine.',\n",
       " 'Citrus-edged sweetness is far more apparent on the palate than the nose, but here it delivers wonderful hints of lemon oil and candied zest, cut through by lively acidity against hints of tropical mango. A wonderfully toned BA, this will pair well with both cheese and dessert.',\n",
       " 'Blending fruit from four vineyards, this opens with dusty aromatics of rose petals, baking spices and cocoa. The mouthfeel continues in a pleasantly dusty vein, showing tart berry and pie-cherry flavors with a lick of mocha.',\n",
       " \"This Prosecco Brut (made with 5% Chardonnay for extra smoothness) delivers floral aromas of dried lavender and rose backed by mineral tones and pulpy peach. It's a lively and generous wine made by Franco Adami, one of the most charismatic and enthusiastic producers in Prosecco land.\",\n",
       " \"A full, rich wine, showing red fruits at their best. It has structure and layers of bright acidity. It's not a wine for long aging, likely to be at its best in three years time.\",\n",
       " \"This is sourced from 1970s-era vines. It's an almost ethereal weave of berry, saffron, mint, cola and tea, all wreathed in light smoke. It shows lovely complexity for such a young wine, and it's got the balance and structure to age nicely. Drink now through 2025.\",\n",
       " \"Pato's pair of old vine wines, a red and this white, are beautifully complex. With its rich melon, tropical fruits, spice and light toastiness, this wine is concentrated with still-young acidity and currant fruit flavors. It's a great wine that needs to develop before drinking. Wait until 2016.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of local Douro white grapes with, unusually, Chenin Blanc, is delicious. With its wood-aged touch and rich creamy texture, the wine is generous and full. It has attractive acidity as well, emphasizing the apple and grapefruit fruit. The wine will be even better from 2018.',\n",
       " 'Made entirely with the native grape Trebbiano Spoletino, this opens with aromas of acacia flower, chamomile and a whiff of tropical fruit. The round medium-bodied palate offers ripe honeydew melon and nectarine zest alongside fresh acidity.',\n",
       " 'This wood-aged wine shows dark berry fruits and a dusty structure. That goes with the juicy fruitiness that is perfumed, fresh and spicy. The wine has a stalky aftertaste with plenty of acidity. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Ripe black-plum and black-cherry aromas lead the nose. This is full in body, with comfortable tannins. Blackberry and baked blueberry flavors end with chocolaty, herbal notes and a coating of blackened toast.',\n",
       " 'A sour tinge of toasty oak invites one in aromatically and taste-wise in this vineyard-designate, from such a stellar Westside Road site. Gravenstein apple and melon pique the palate while it remains balanced and beautifully textured through the spicy finish.',\n",
       " \"Brimming with ripe black plum and cherry flavors, this densely concentrated wine is unabashedly fruity and forward. It's well balanced though, showcasing crisp acidity and nuanced hints of rose petal and granite. Fine-grained but penetrating tannins persist on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"Unripe green notes of leaves detract from this wine's enjoyment. It's crisp in acidity, with some pure Meyer lemon, lime and fig flavors, but that vegetal note is bothersome.\",\n",
       " \"This is drinkable but not overly interesting, with a good berry flavor. It's marked with an off-putting aroma of cigarette ash, and it feels raw.\",\n",
       " 'Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin. Touches of oak, tobacco, dried plum and cardamom fill the aroma, and ripe but not overripe black cherry, tamarind and cola flavors flood the palate, supported by fine-grained tannins and medium-full body.',\n",
       " 'Barely there but intriguing notes of pears draw you in first. The soft body promises refreshment and rounded pleasure, with just enough phenolic texture and a hint of salty minerality.',\n",
       " 'Dense and well structured, this is going to be an attractive wine. It has blackberry fruit, plenty of crisp acidity and a structured aftertaste. Drink from 2018.',\n",
       " \"A restrained nose softly hints at tart berry and citrus. The palate is fresh but less precise when it comes to fruit: the body is light, dry and fresh, with a lasting note of citrus zestiness. With a clean finish and a tiny hint of grip, it's a wonderful rosé for the table.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of blackberry, plum, coffee and toast lead the nose. The full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, toasted oak, coconut and oak-driven spice alongside assertive tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink soon before the remaining fruit disappears.',\n",
       " 'Bougros is one of the richest, opulent of the Grand Cru Chablis. In this fruit-driven year, the wine is wonderfully spicy, rich and full of fine fruit. Yellow fruits dominate the balancing citrus and wood flavors. It is so forward that it could be drunk now, but this fine wine will be much better from 2019',\n",
       " 'Scents of bacon fat from the new French oak introduce a tight young wine. The cured meat aromas and flavors somehow suggest a splash of Syrah in the blend, though none is noted. Give it a couple more years to smooth out and let the fruit come through.',\n",
       " \"This wine shows everything that Chardonnay lovers want. It's enormously rich and ripe in mango, pineapple, orange and peach flavors, enriched with sweet new oak and creamy lees. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'This fruity wine is ripe with black fruits and generous tannins. It has plenty of acidity to balance the fruit, giving a wine that is both crisp and packed with fruit. The structure is already just right. Drink from 2018.',\n",
       " \"The color is almost black, and lots of dark berry and black pepper aromas come out. This wine's flavors are even more pronounced, tasting peppery, meaty and like boysenberries. Dense \\xadtannins make the mouthfeel thick and layered. A lingering finish attests to its considerable concentration.\",\n",
       " 'Big, fat Pinot Gris, with the typical spice and ripe fruit. The wine is full and round, attractively filled with peach fruits and a hint of fine acidity. Screw cap.',\n",
       " 'Firm and structured, this has dense tannins as well as fruity character. Both the texture and the black plum fruits are concentrated. Flavors of wood aging have smoothed out the naturally stalky character of the fruit. Drink from 2016.',\n",
       " \"You can quibble with the price, but there's no doubt about the quality of this Zin. It's extraordinarily deeply flavored, offering waves of wild cherries, cola, anise, molé sauce, pepper spice and sandalwood, wrapped into profoundly fine tannins, and with a long, dry finish. Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of tire rubber, herb and red fruit lead to soft, plush cranberry and cherry flavors that linger.',\n",

       " 'What a fine Chardonnay. Made in a bone dry, minerally style, it may not have the immediately seductive quality of some Chards, but it does show a Chablis-like elegance that makes it a natural for food pairing, with its fine citrus and steel tang and mouthwatering acidity.',\n",
       " 'The wine comes from one of the cru estates followed by this negociant house. It is a light, ripe and fruity wine. With its attractive red-berry flavors, finished with crisp acidity, it is accessible and ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'Bramble and cedar, along with plenty of toasty vanillin oak. Black currant is the dominant fruit; the mouthfeel is appropriately big, and the finish turns a bit dry, but with proper length. Very nice in the typical Napa mold.',\n",
       " 'Especially for a more affordable bottling, Joey Tensley packs in a ton of density on this bottling, from the color to the nose to the palate. Hearty aromas of black currant, charred blackberry, dusty sagebrush and a hint of caramel drop into a deep and rich but not overripe palate of tar and blackened fruit. Soft tannins coat the mouth fully.',\n",
       " \"A very nice Zinfandel, rich and spicy, with black currant, dark chocolate, raisin, tobacco, pepper and cedar flavors. It's a bit overripe, especially in the finish. Drink up.\",\n",
       " 'Leather and a mild green funkiness surround spicy berry and cherry aromas. This feels rather heavy and lacking in agility. Grapey flavors of baked berry fruits are overweight on a savory-tasting finish.',\n",
       " 'This is a big, concentrated and rather Burgundian Pinot Noir. It shows powerful flavors of cherry pie, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates and dried herbs, with an earthy, mushroomy complexity. Feels young and tannic and thick in wood sap, yet its future is hard to predict.',\n",
       " \"Besides the Malbec, there is also 12% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. The grapes are from the Gold Vineyards in the Rogue Valley. Aged 13 months in French oak, it's showing a big burst of vanilla in both nose and flavor, along with cranberry fruit and some rugged dusty tannins. Another year of bottle age would help to integrate the oak a bit further.\",\n",
       " 'Rabajà is among the most celebrated single vineyards in Barbaresco. The cru is known for its elegant yet muscular wines that perform well either aged or when drunk young. This expression exhibits notes of raspberry and cherry with shadings of vanilla and spice. It also shows some creamy or lactic notes of white chocolate that will dissolve within a few years.',\n",
       " 'This is a concentrated wine, full of blackberry fruits with acidity and spice. The wood-aging character is balancing out well, giving structure without dominating the fruit. Drink from 2020. Grapes are vinified by variety and plot from the 60-acre vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (40%) and Petit Verdot (5%). The property was purchased by Jean-Christophe Mau in 2004.',\n",

       " 'Black and thick, a study in smoky oak and tar, this intense vineyard-designated Cabernet will behave better over time. Brawny tannins surround substantial layers of blackberry and coffee, the feel on the palate weighty and voluptuous. Cellar through 2026.',\n",
       " 'Richly textured and generously flavored, this wine shows how good Livermore Cabernet can be. Aged in new Hungarian barrels, it has cedar and spice aromas, seductive ripe fruit flavors and a mouth-filling, palate-soothing viscosity bolstered by loads of fine-grained tannins. Best from 2018.',\n",
       " 'A perfumed, aromatic wine, dry yet full of fresh, fragrant white fruit flavors. A steely edge is followed by hints of currants and a complex, still-youthful texture. Drink from 2015.',\n",

       " \"Very light in color, this bottling by the Coppola family shows sweeter aromas of Gravenstein apple, ripe pear, honeysuckle and tuberose on the nose. It's also a tad sweet on the palate, especially for today's sparkling standards, but will surely attract a wide fan base thanks to apple custard, cotton candy and plumeria-like flavors, all dissected by racy bubbles and acidity.\",\n",
       " 'Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.',\n",
       " 'This blend of Rabigato and Códega do Larinho grapes brings out the crisp acidity of a Douro white. The wine has a fragrant character with hedgerow fruits and white flower aromas. The aftertaste goes more towards yellow fruits while keeping all the freshness.',\n",

       " \"The famous growers branch out into their own wines with aplomb in this 100% varietal wine, tangoing with a much sought-after grape from their property. Sanguine and gamy, it's structured in good acidity and low oak, showing a succulence of blackberry.\",\n",
       " \"This reflects the Yarra region's Pinot Noir character well, combining earthy, cola- and beet-scented notes with well-ripened tannins and medium body. There's a fair bit of textural richness for such a modestly priced Pinot. Drink now.\",\n",

It's a very fine wine, dry and elegantly constructed, with little of the baby fat over-the-topness that affects some Napa Cabs. Within that firm structure are extraordinarily complex blackberry, black currant and spicy plum flavors. Delicious now despite the firm tannins, and should develop over the next 8–10 years, at least.\",\n",

       " 'Bone dry and pretty tannic at the age of four-plus years, this Merlot has interesting flavors of cherries, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are fierce, but pliant. Should soften and mellow over the next 6–8 years.',\n",
       " 'Organically grown grapes give this wine a pure and fruity character that makes it instantly attractive. It is crisp, laced with lemon and lively, juicy red fruits. The aftertaste is dry and full of flavor.',\n",

The mouthfeel is big, the texture rich and the full, spicy finish is long and tannic. It's drinkable now, but really needs a few years to unwrap a bit, and the oak mantle will probably always be heavy. Satisfying, though somewhat one-dimensional.\",\n",
       " 'This has traditionally been a top bottling for Sojourn, and the 2011 is especially good. The vibrant acidity and pineapple, tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors are intense and pure. Drink it now and over the next three years.',\n",

       " 'Only a few producers import wines made with the Pecorino variety, and if you like fresh, light Italian whites they are definitely worth trying. This expression is redolent of fresh pear, honey and Golden Delicious apple and even has a slightly greenish hue within its pretty golden highlights.',\n",

Opening with alluring scents of iris, rose, culinary spice and perfumed berry, the focused palate delivers crushed strawberry, red cherry, cinnamon and star anise.

       " 'Scents of honey, pear and cinnamon waft from the glass; the flavors are of baked pears and apples, but never turn too soft or blowsy. Warming on the finish, with lots of dried spices and toast.',\n",

       " 'Aromatically compelling with floral, stone fruit and mineral highlights, this offers palate-cleansing freshness. The mineral-drenched flavors blend melon, peach and lemon rind, with a finishing burst of lime. It was fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel.',\n",
       " 'This spent 16 months in neutral oak, and it shows some muted scents that may be attributed to those barrels. Earthy unripe fruit, tasting mainly of apple skins, also sends up light whiffs of fish oil. Drink up.',\n",
       " \"Blackberry and cherry notes are fresh and primary in this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, but shaded with interesting notes of coffee and smoke.

       " 'Honey, concentrated pear juice, candied tangerine rind and a light botanical aroma show on this dynamic dessert wine. The palate is expectedly sweet but cut by a driving, mouth-searing acidity, showing flavors of pear and apple skins, ripe stone fruit, golden raisins and lemon rinds.',\n",
       " 'This delivers excellent value, with dark fruit aromas, tight tannins and a lingering spice note. The wine is aged partly in oak and partly in stainless steel. It would make an excellent partner to barbecued meats.',\n",
       " 'A very shy nose just releases the most teasing hint of peach. The palate is utterly restrained: peach flavors are dry and brightened by lemon and have a wonderful lightness of touch. The finish is dry, clean and long. A very refreshing and clean-cut take on Gewurztraminer.',\n",
       " 'Named for a beautifully restored castle and boutique hotel in Abruzzo, this beautiful Italian white (made with Trebbiano grapes) shows a delicious creamy texture with abundant aromas of stone fruit, honey and toasted almond. The wine is thick and textured on the close.',\n",

       " \"A blend of Syrah, Zin and several other Rhône varieties, this is a soft, lusty wine, likeable for its array of ripe, forward fruit flavors. Cherries, blackberries, raspberries and licorice flood the mouth, finishing with a peacock's tail of dusty Asian spices.\",\n",
       " \"Robust and richly layered, this block-designate from the producer's estate is sly in complexity, pumping its fist in ripeness and concentration before slowly unfurling elements of dusty black cherry, black olive and fig. The finish teases in white pepper and cardamom.\",\n",

       " \"The wine is always a blend of the winery's best vineyards in the northern, warm section of the valley, including Allen, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem's Estate.

       " 'Lemon and grapefruit rind provide a brightness to the nose and palate here, along a creamier outpouring of butterscotch and savory dried stone fruit. A lacing of minerality is pronounced throughout, with the finish complete in sharp edges complemented by a sense of soft brioche.',\n",
       " \"Leather, fresh mushroom and stalky notes surround a core of black-fruit aromas. This feels hard and choppy, with bold acidity that isn't fully integrated. Plum and berry flavors end in a bright finish driven by the acidity.\",\n",
       " \"This wine is expansive and juicy on the palate. A tight grip shows its youth while the underlying softness on the texture reflects the relative coolness of the growing spot. It imparts Napa's robust ripeness in its depth of cassis, chocolate and black pepper.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of ripe blackberry, brown spice and fragrant blue flower waft from the glass. A blend of 50% Negroamaro, 25% Primitivo and 25% Malvasia Nera, the savory, approachable palate delivers black cherry, cranberry, nutmeg and mineral alongside firm tannins.',\n",
       " \"A good, strong, sturdy wine, filled with classic blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors. It's dry and rich, but the tannins are aggressive. They're edgy and tough and off-putting. It may be the kind of old-fashioned wine that comes around after 10 or 15 years.\",\n",
       " \"Though it's 100% varietal, this sports a strong floral streak, as if dominated by Gewürztraminer. Baby-powder scents and accents shift into a fruit core of citrus, with Meyer lemon, oranges and pineapple.\",\n",
       " 'Hints of honeycomb and beeswax add heft to the notes of fresh green flower and sweet citrus. Ripe yet elegantly composed, this has concentrated fruit flavors that extend onto a long, honeysuckle-kissed finish.',\n",
       " 'This ambitious, impressively structured wine will appeal to those who run from wines made in the fruit-bomb style. The subdued nose has earthy notes, while the palate is all about minerals and green pepper. A year or two in the cellar will allow the grippy tannins to integrate.',\n",
       " \"Dry, spicy and showing aromas of cherry and herbs that are true to the grape. Medium bodied, with light cherry, raspberry and peppery flavors, and the finish is toasty and oaky, with cocoa. A touch herbal and strained but for the most part it's true, likable Pinot Noir.\",\n",
       " \"A granular, horsey note is the greeting, and never does this truly find its sweet spot. The aromas are raisiny, while the palate is angular and acidic. Flavors of tomato, herb, tobacco and plum don't quite find their footing. The finish is thick and tastes of molasses, carob and herb.\",\n",
       " 'Fatagione delivers great intensity of cola, mint, licorice and rosemary-like aromas. The finish is dusty and dry, high lighted by brimstone and crushed mineral.',\n",

       " \"A baked lemon, honeyed aspect of this wine makes it seem overripe in many ways, a lush, full-bodied characteristic that seems slightly overdone. From one of the farming family's Green Valley ranches, it's intense and creamy.\",\n",
       " \"Very inviting, incredibly rich aromas of butterscotch, crème brûlée, peach custard, lemon curds, honeysuckle and caramelized banana show on this wine's thick nose. The palate offers orange peels cooked in a buttery sauce, marshmallows and marzipan.\",\n",

       " 'A rich, vital, complex Pinot Noir. Completely dry, with a savory scour of acidity, it treads a fine line between ripe cherries and pomegranates and earthier notes of mushrooms and dried herbs. Lots of terroir in this fine wine, which will take a few years of bottle age.',\n",
       " \"Lots of ripe blackberry and cherry fruit in this Cabernet, accented with notes of licorice and oak. It's a good wine, full-bodied, tannic and dry. Very good now, especially after a brief decant, but too dependent on fruit for a higher score, and doesn't seem like an ager.\",\n",
       " \"Black raspberry and wet black slate are most prevalent on the nose of this wine from one of the appellation's most reliable vineyards, but it also shows an ample amount of black spices, from cardamom to star anise.

Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this 07 shows the balance of the vintage, with gorgeous tannins and focused characteristic of a mountain vineyard.

       " 'Swanson employs former winemaker Marco Cappelli to make this nonvintage dessert wine, working with Mission grape vines in the Shenandoah Valley that were planted in 1856 and reside at a 1,300-foot elevation.

The result is delicious, a strong essence of cherry, dried fruit and molasses perfectly sippable and balanced.',\n",

       " 'A proud signature of Molise, Don Luigi Riserva is a lovely Montepulciano-based wine—with 10% Aglianico—that opens with dark aromas of leather, tobacco, bitter chocolate and plump blackberry. It delivers solid tannins backed by smooth concentration.',\n",
       " \"This is a perfumed, fragrant wine. Its acidity is offset by the red berry and currant fruits that add freshness to the dry, crisp character. It's a full wine, with good fruit depth and ripe flavors, and will be better with food. Drink now.\",\n",

       " \"This wine comes from less than an acre in Mâcon's smallest appellation. The result is a tight wine with a steely edge. Strong citrus and crisp apple flavors are lifted by the nervy acidity and finished with a shot of lemon juice. Let this wine calm down and drink from 2017.\",\n",
       " 'This is floral and candied upfront, with a red licorice note. It feels full and fleshy, with hints of red berry and cassis, with not too much oak on the palate. Ripe, basic, clean and sweet as a whole.',\n",
       " \"There's an easy, informal quality to this white wine that makes it appropriate to pair with roast chicken or baked fish. The Pecorino grape can often be heavy and buttery, but this expression is surprisingly fresh and zesty instead.\",\n",

The tannins carry a hint of green, turning a little rough in the finish.',\n",
       " \"Earthy aromas suggest tilled soil, savory herb, leather, dried rose and a whiff of game. The bright palate offers crushed cherry, black raspberry, savory herb and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's well balanced and fresh. A licorice note signals the close.\",\n",

       " 'This rarely explored grape, also known as Trebbiano, proves quite exciting in this bottling. Aromas recall ripe lime flesh, white flowers, green apples, Asian pears and white peach, with a nearly tropical banana sap character. The palate tightens around the limey acidity, showing some ripe red apple, but remaining bright, ready to pair with everything from roast chicken to shellfish.',\n",
       " \"This esteemed winery's younger Chardonnays are all about tension and the future. This begins with slightly sour aromas of yogurt and goat cheese along with shave fennel, radish, daikon and lemongrass.

       " 'From a selection of different parcels near the Torto and Pinhão rivers, this is a beautifully ripe and fruity wine.

       " 'This is tasty in a ripe, extravagantly fruity way. Raspberry and strawberry aromas seem as sweet as syrup. The full body and alcoholic strength give it a strong texture, but without too much tannic grip. Barbecued ribs or a cheese plate could be great matches.',\n",
       " 'Slightly austere, this Pinot Gris is marked by aromas of orange blossom and cheese rind, with a crispness on the finish that resembles a ripe, green apple.',\n",
       " \"Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years. Flavors of toasted bread and apple are long on complexity and short on fruit, but once again that's what distinguishes Gramona from the masses.\",\n",
       " \"This lightly sparkling, terroir-driven wine is loaded with soul and finesse. It's ethereal and bone dry, with delicately alluring aromas and flavors of white spring flower, ripe apple, Bartlett pear, citrus and Alpine herb. Crisp acidity and a silky mousse provide balance and finesse while a mineral note energizes the focused finish. The sediment at the bottom of the bottle adds even more flavor to the last glass.\",\n",
       " 'Subdued aromas of French oak, underbrush, espresso and menthol lead the way. The rather lean but polished palate offers tart sour cherry, vanilla and roasted coffee bean alongside vibrant acidity and firm tannins that grip the finish.',\n",
       " 'This small property with its own château lies within the lower portion of Vaudésir but is considered a Grand Cru in its own right. The wine—the flagship of the cooperative—is opulent, showing strong wood aging flavors that will soften with time. Ripe and generous with yellow fruit flavor, it also boasts a tight mineral acidity and crispness, making it a good candidate for cellaring. Drink from 2021.',\n",
       " 'This is another impressive effort from Cogno, offering aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, fragrant flowers, underbrush and menthol. The firm, precise palate offers dried black cherry, cinnamon, anise, clove, cocoa and mineral set against a tannic backbone and brisk acidity. Give this time to develop even more complexity. Drink 2019–2031.',\n",
       " \"The nose of this wine is soft and toasty, with notes of sweet cream and butter. The creamy mouthfeel offers bursts of buttered popcorn, pineapple and toasted Challah. It's a nice choice if you like a round, buttery Chardonnay. The flavors, however, don't linger on the finish and instead turn slightly bitter.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and layered in crisp melon, lime and lemon zest, this aromatic SB is complex and kissed by honeysuckle. It's a natural go-to for shellfish, especially Hog Island oysters from the coast near Point Reyes. A warm goat cheese salad would also do nicely.\",\n",

       " \"Rough cherry and plum aromas are indicative of what's to come. This feels fresh but raw, with high acidity and not much body or depth. Tart plum and cranberry flavors finish with sharp acidity and a drawing sensation.\",\n",

       " 'The wine in this 100% Pinot Noir comes from one of the top villages in the Montagne de Reims. It is rich, structured and with a youthful character despite its nine years . It has berry and rich plum fruits as well as a dry core of acidity. Drink this ageworthy Champagne from 2019.',\n",
       " \"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm.

       " \"Barolo San Lorenzo has very nice intensity—it's there, but not in your face. The wine is already starting to show some interesting mineral components that are backed by black fruit, licorice and truffle. Its intensity builds in the glass and although it starts slow, it picks up loads of speed in the mouth. Drink after 2015.\",\n",
       " \"Made from 100% Merlot, this shows the enormous fruit of Mount Veeder. The cherry and blackberry flavors are concentrated and pure, and there are liqueur-like notes of cassis and anise, plus a sweet toast accent from the oak. It's dry and quite tannic, but not to the extreme that it can't be consumed now.\",\n",
       " \"The Grandlieu lake, to the west of the Sèvre et Maine Muscadet vineyards, produces softer wines, like this. This wine is ripe, with hints of toast and vanilla as well as fresh and crisp apple acidity. It's a full-bodied, rounded wine that is just ready to drink and will be better from 2016.\",\n",
       " 'Very big, very rich, almost a fruit store in itself. Offers a wild ride of intensely ripe, extracted cherries, currants, blackberries and blueberries that taste like jam spread on buttery toast, then sprinkled with cinnamon and cocoa. Also fairly tannic and full-bodied. Lacks some delicacy, but delicious and dramatic.',\n",

       " \"This is a huge and impressive step up from the 2003 Astrales, which was fine but not at this level. Here we're talking about color, bouquet, palate feel, intense flavors, finish, you name it. It's pure, ultratasty, chocolaty, smooth and pleasurable. Astrales is the complete package and a wine to watch.\",\n",

It's full of fruit and savory flavors, with firm tannins backing it all up. An impressive wine, this should have a long life ahead of it.\",\n",
       " 'Pure and friendly tart apple and sweet pear fruit are very appetizing. The palate emphasises fruity sweetness but is kept in check and balance. Residual sweetness will make this shine in certain food contexts while the backbone of bright, citric acidity provides a great counterpoint.',\n",

       " \"Good, but not without problems. It's dry and tannicly smooth in the mouth, with black cherry and mocha flavors. But there's a tart, sandpapery roughness that's just a little short of ripe. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"This opens with pure, attractive nectarine and apricot aromas, along with hints of mineral and petrol. It feels pure and racy, with delicious, clean flavors of pineapple, honey and mango. It's delicate and fresh on the finish, with just enough weight to be taken seriously.\",\n",
       " 'Ripe Bosc pear, yellow apple, herb and citrus zest aromas follow through to the medium-bodied palate, along with tangy acidity. A hint of white almond backs up the crisp finish.',\n",
       " 'With delicate aromas of orange blossom and lime, this wine takes on a viscosity of texture on the palate, offering plump flavors of peach and guava. Refined and well made, the finish is a combination of vanilla and caramel.',\n",
       " \"This is a soft and sweet effort. It's a good wine, with raspberry and cherry jam flavors. This bottling from Armanino has been inconsistent over the years.\",\n",
       " \"A dusty Amador County-dominant old-vine Zinfandel with plenty of spicy berry, mocha and licorice flavor. Packaged in a psychedelically inspired label, it'll go down easy on those late-night when listening to music is the best thing to do and plenty of barbecued meat is lying around.\",\n",
       " \"Crisp and fruity, this bright and fruity wine has attractive acidity as well as spice and a lightly tangy texture. It's still very fresh and needs time to deepen and become richer. Drink from 2016.\",\n",
       " \"A rounded style of Sauvignon Blanc, but one that doesn't lose sight of its herbaceous element. So there is crispness, a vivacious acidity, but also flavors of creamy apple and ripe pear. To drink this year.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a fresh, savory white made from Trebbiano and Sémillon grapes. It opens with aromas of pineapple, exotic fruit and white wildflowers that carry over to the linear palate alongside Mediterranean herb, yellow peach and lemon zest. Tangy acidity provides balance and generates a crisp, clean finish.\",\n",
       " 'Key lime and fresh cut Gala apples meet with the spiciness of lemongrass on the nose of this bottling from Nicky Hahn and winemaker Paul Clifton. The palate shows a pithy texture, with honeydew melon, Asian pear and lemon cake.',\n",

       " 'In 1999, Stéphane and Paola Gabard resurrected winemaking at an estate that has belonged to the family since the 18th century. Ripe, rich and still retaining its youthful structure, this concentrated wine will need time. With its dense texture and layers of black-currant fruit, it has a fine future. Drink from 2019.',\n",
       " 'Well structured wine with plenty of ripe fruit. The freshness of fruit is replaced by spice and peach flavors.',\n",
       " \"Shows the impeccable viticulture and winemaking talent that mark all of Jarvis's red wines. The tannins and acidity are considerable, giving the cherry flavor such a nice bite. A lovely wine to drink now with steak or Italian-inspired beef dishes.\",\n",
       " \"Soft, ripe and chocolaty, with a raisiny quality on the bouquet. There's fading black plum and wild berry flavors; the mouthfeel is big but short on structure. Finishes with medium length and mild bitterness.\",\n",
       " \"The herbal Boulder Bluff bottling remains rather stubbornly closed, even after being open for several hours. It's tart with fruit flavors of cranberry and green apple.\",\n",
       " 'Hints of lemon curd and struck flint emerge from they lass, while the palate reveals flavors of apple, pear and citrus. With its pared-back flavors and restrained nature, this medium-bodied Chardonnay should prove versatile at the table. Drink now–2016.',\n",

       " \"Nothing is out of place in this wine: It's intense, but it's not too strong, and the bouquet shows a balance of sweet fruit and savory spice aromas.\",\n",
       " 'Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness.',\n",
       " 'Dark and smoky, like hickory burning alongside blackberry, spice and turned earth. The palate has jammy black plum and blackberry flavors mixed with herbs, while good acidity gives it length. Finishes long, spicy and herbal, with enough freshness to make it food friendly.',\n",
       " \"For such a small price, this off-dry Riesling offers surprising refreshment and enjoyment. It's straightforward and fruity, bursting with white-peach and pear flavors, yet remarkably pristine in style. Zesty lemon-lime acidity showers the midpalate and leads a long rejuvenating finish.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and brittle, with some sharp tannic edges. Yet it's good and ripe in blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar. Decent price for a Napa Cab.\",\n",
       " \"A fresh and crisp, though unusual, wine. It has pleasing flavors yet tastes like it's made from flowers rather than fruit. There's jasmine, honeysuckle—you name it—on both the nose and the palate. Lean in the mouth, with a hint of apple skin toward the finish.\",\n",
       " \"Mostly Garnacha (with 12% Syrah), this Mediterranean-styled wine is locked and loaded on the nose: There's a ton of mineral, sunshine and earthy blackberry aromas. The palate is full with cherry and raspberry, and the acidity is strong enough to keep the wine stable. In the end it's almost lean and perky.\",\n",
       " 'This is a soft, smooth and ethereally light red wine, bright and fresh in cassis and a wild element of sage. As it develops in the glass, the rounded approachability adds seasonings of leather and cinnamon.',\n",
       " 'This is barrel fermented, with noticeable flavors of heavily buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Bright with crisp acidity, it also features notes of ripe pineapple, pear, peach and mango.',\n",
       " 'This well-priced white wine is simple and clean with fruit-driven aromas of peach, melon and honey. You can taste sweet notes from the strong sunshine and the wine has good density and firmness throughout.',\n",
       " \"An extraordinarily decadent Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah blend, currently among the best in California. Hard to describe how delicious the raspberry, blackberry, chocolate, orange, granola, sandalwood and spice flavors are. There's a rich, velvety, liqueur-like texture, and while the wine tastes fantastically sweet, it finishes dry, a marvelous achievement. Production was a mere 315 cases.\",\n",
       " 'Quite toasty, with deep scents of buttered nuts, this luscious wine delivers generous flavors of new barrels, ripe apples, pears and buttered popcorn, set against defining acids.',\n",
       " 'This 50-50 split of Zinfandel and Syrah is skunky and heavy, a toasty concoction of boysenberry and blackberry jam that finishes abruptly with an herbal afternote.',\n",
       " 'Leather and peppercorn jump from the glass in this soft, strong wine, powerful in tannin and dusty earth. A gravelly, rocky component plays on the palate around waves of chocolate and black currant, finishing in herb.',\n",
       " 'Too soft in acidity, so the blackberry, currant, cherry liqueur and spice flavors have a curious jamminess. The softness and high alcohol emphasize sweetness, affecting the finish.',\n",

       " 'Once the sulfur note blows off this young wine, the tart berry and cherry aromas and flavors wear cocoa and tobacco accents. On the tongue an even palate-feel and smooth texture please, and decent acidity supports the fruit.',\n",
       " \"This is a fresh but immediately informal sparkling wine with drying mineral notes backed by peach, citrus and chopped herbs. It's low-impact and compact in the mouth but does offer a pristine, polished finish.\",\n",
       " \"The wine is ripe, weighty and full of fruit. Its tannins are already softening into the blackberry flavors. The sole question about this wine is the excessive wood aging that has given a burnt edge. Hopefully, this blend of 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot will assert its natural fruitiness. Don't drink before 2020.\",\n",
       " \"Threads of licorice, steel, earth and smoke weave through the proportionate strawberry and raspberry flavors, offset by hints of herb and baking spice. It's a seamless, complex wine of moderate length.\",\n",
       " 'All Riesling, this aromatic wine conveys notes of jasmine, peach and pear. It drinks off dry, with spritzy soda water and stone-fruit flavors and mouthwatering acidity.',\n",
       " \"A salty lick of saline brings the palate to attention before tingling acidity seals the experience: the wine's backbone a nicely balanced combination of generous oak that supports ripe fruit. Francois Freres and Taransaud barrels cradled the wine for 10 months, only 35% of it new, making for a robust yet elegant expression of the variety from this site.\",\n",
       " 'The light grassy aroma and mild citrus flavor are pretty quiet, yet this wine still comes through with a vibrant texture, crisp acidity and good, tangy finish. It should make a pleasant match with lots of appetizers, salads and creamy pastas.',\n",
       " \"A wisp of smoke lends a sultry tone to fresh pear in this dry, supple wine. It's ripe and rich on the palate, but maintains the lean, steely acidity ubiquitous to this vintage. Finishes long with rolling mineral notes.\",\n",
       " 'This Merlot is dark in the glass, with lots of oak, vanilla and caramel aromas against a black-cherry and chocolate-cake backdrop on the nose. Soft and chalky tannins frame the sip, where blueberry, vanilla and chocolate-cream flavors prove lush and inviting.',\n",
       " 'Licorice, fennel and tropical guava provide a flourish of savory and ripe around a fleshy, rounded and smooth overlay unimpeded by oak, the wine aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak barrels.',\n",

       " 'Mature plum, cake spices, baked earth, leather and a balsamic note all come together on this full-bodied, single-vineyard offering. The forward, savory palate delivers mature black cherry, clove and licorice alongside ripe, assertive tannins.',\n",
       " 'Toasted sandalwood, hints of sagebrush, crushed pencils, tart cranberry and vanilla brioche show on the nose of this bottling. The tannic structure is light but shows structure and tension, with rich flavors of cherry, cola, vanilla and clove.',\n",
       " \"This fresh wine also offers plenty of ripe fruit and exotic flavors. Crisp, juicy and rich, it's just lightly touched by honey and is a refreshing wine to drink now.\",\n",
       " 'An orange shade of pink, this wine leans toward dried lemon and orange peels with a slight bit of bubble gum and pomegranate on the nose. The flavors are more concentrated than bright, with iodine and dried fruit character, more reminiscent of an orange wine than a pink one.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of baking spice, herb, vanilla, wood spice and cherry lead to lightly sweet fruit flavors. The oak is overwhelming, making the variety hard to find.',\n",
       " \"Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex. A clean, straightforward wine with zest but limited flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Very dry and very crisp, with lime, lemongrass and mineral flavors. Considerable new French oak brings creamier notes, while 15% Viognier in the blend adds an exotic tang. It impresses for dry, zesty elegance. An interesting wine, and one to watch in future vintages.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of cassis, chopped herb and licorice lead the nose and carry over to the medium-bodied palate along with dried cherry and espresso. Fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.',\n",
       " \"Stéphane Brocard is based in Marsannay the northernmost vineyard in Burgundy's Côte d'Or. This wine comes from two small parcels with 35-year-old vines. It is already fruity and attractive, although the tannins do promise aging. Crisp with the pure acidity of the vintage, it will develop well and should be drunk from late 2017.\",\n",
       " 'Bright and easy drinking, this opens with aromas of red berry, tobacco, menthol and spice. The vibrant palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and star anise alongside racy acidity and soft, supple tannins. Drink soon.',\n",
       " 'A fruity blend of local Lisboa grapes along with Chardonnay, this wine is rich and full of citrus and crisp apple flavors. It is a ripe wine with a creamy texture enhanced by toast from the wood aging. Drink this wine from late 2017.',\n",
       " 'A wine that is ripe with a firmly tannic edge as well as rich black fruits. Juicy acidity and black fruits come from the eclectic blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Merlot and Syrah. The wine is still young although with its fruitiness it is ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'Made from the same blend as the dry Orvieto, in this version fermentation is stopped before all the sugars are converted to alcohol. A moderately sweet wine, it boasts apricot, honey and almond notes, with just enough acidity to avoid a cloying finish. Pair it with cream cheeses or almond cookies.',\n",
       " \"While this Chardonnay has rich tropical fruit and citrus flavors, with a light touch of oak, the acidity and minerality make it taste clean and balanced. Don't drink it too cold, and be sure to enjoy it with Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of herbs and desert brush blend with raisiny berry scents. This feels grabby and tannic, while jammy, herbal berry flavors flatten out with airing. A loamy tasting finish loses some intensity and spirit as this settles.',\n",
       " 'Blackberry and animal aromas precede a rubbery, tannic, full-bodied palate. This rugged, black-colored Malbec pumps out big blackberry flavors in front of a chocolaty but short finish with emerging oak.',\n",
       " \"Aromas of fresh-baked bread greet the nose on entry into this wine, an unusual find in the appellation that's blended with small percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Toast topped in plum jam accompanies a strong presence of blackberry, leather and tobacco, dusted in cinnamon. Drink now through 2023.\",\n",
       " \"The cool-climate-loving Alvarinho translates well to the coastal Lisboa region. It's rich and creamy, acidity well in hand and supporting the melon and citrus flavors. It's a delicious wine now, but it will age, so keep it until 2015.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of beeswax, lychee and fragrant white flowers take center stage in this wine. The juicy palate offers ripe Bartlett pear and lemon drop alongside fresh acidity.',\n",
       " 'This big and brawny bottling from the first winery to popularize the varietal is full bodied and appropriately tannic while offering meaty, smoky, savory aromas and flavors. It is dry and a bit astringent in texture, needing rich food to go with it, or at least until 2022 in the cellar.',\n",
       " 'Crisp, focused aromas of minerals and red fruits are correct for Priorat. This Garnacha-led blend is firm, tannic and drawing in the mouth, but not raw. Flavors of ripe, gritty, roasted berry fruits finish minerally, with a note of licorice. Drink this standard but delicious wine now.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful sparkling wine, rich and refined in the mouth, with creamy flavors that show ripe, sweet California strawberries and limes. This bottling gets better and better with each new release.',\n",
       " 'An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.',\n",
       " 'More or less clean and neutral on the nose, with aromatic notes of peach and apple. The palate is juicy but sort of jumpy, with flavors of orange, pithy bitterness and roast corn. Good in this price range but seemingly on its way to being past its prime.',\n",
       " 'With a slight prickle on the tongue, this off-dry wine is crisp, fruity, packed with citrus and with fine acidity. It is zesty, tangy and a pleasure to drink with its bright flavors and texture. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'This dry light-bodied wine smells very fresh—even green—and tastes like tart green apples, white pepper and fresh parsley. It has very crisp acidity and a mouth-puckering texture that will make it a good pairing with raw oysters.',\n",
       " 'Black fruit and cherry leads on this balanced red. Flavors of black pepper, black currant and plum on the palate are round but not overbearing. A good daily red to pair with pastas, stews and meat dishes.',\n",
       " 'Feeble scents of tropical fruit and rose petal mark the nose of this wine, which leads into the light- to medium-bodied palate that offers bright acids, soft flavors and a delicate, tapering finish.',\n",
       " 'Light aromas of tropical fruits and acacia blossom show a note of ginger. This has a citrusy, fairly full body and flavors of lime, pineapple and mango that turn more towards citrus on the finish.',\n",
       " 'A surprisingly nonperfumed Traminer that moves much more into the realm of sweetness, ripe yellow fruits and balancing acidity. The light and delicious character creates a great apéritif.',\n",
       " \"Proprietor Maurizio Fuselli's 100% Syrah from coastal Tuscany—his debut vintage—could not be more encouraging. The wine exhibits pure berry fruit: Blackberry and cherry is backed by leather, spice and cigar box. The wine has tight, solid tannins, good length and a long, cherry-driven finish.\",\n",
       " \"Rich, ripe and tropical, this calls to mind bananas soaked in cream. Round and lightly spicy, it's a forward, fruit-driven wine with a veneer of spice and toast, but enough acid to keep it lively.\",\n",
       " \"Boosted with 5% Barbera, this bottling for the estate's Bootjack Ranch shows ripe cranberry, red cherry, a pinch of herbs and touches of caramel and coffee syrup on the nose. A dense core of black plum skins at the palate's core is surrounded by bright cherry fruit, evolving into a dark chocolate and espresso touch.\",\n",
       " \"A comforting nose of vanilla toast, butter and a spin of citrus starts this venerable producer's elegant Chardonnay. On the palate, the wine is creamy, with integrated fresh fruit and spice components, and offers a lingering, unctuous finish.\",\n",
       " \"Plush, ripe apple and apricots are dusted in savory, earthy notes of slate and spice. It's a dancing, delicately framed wine with a balance of soft, sweet fruit and zesty acidity. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"A sweaty smell opens the wine, followed with light strawberry and leafy herb notes. In the mouth the wine is thin and tart, with a hard, tannic finish. There isn't any stuffing, and it lacks the elegance and precision that could take the place of mere power. What's left is leafy, herbal and astringent, but charmless. Two bottles tasted.\",\n",
       " 'There is a lot of fruit in the aroma and flavor of this wine. That, along with a touch of floral influence, make this medium-bodied wine fresh and alluring. Notes like Anjou pear, jasmine, ripe peach and a hint of vanilla swirl softly around the palate.',\n",
       " 'Made from native grape Susumaniello, this conveys aromas of charred earth, mature plum and a hint of coffee bean. The soft, dense palate offers juicy black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and a note of black pepper alongside ripe, velvety tannins. Drink through 2016.',\n",
       " 'A grassy element surrounds searing layers of lime and kiwi, the wine from a prominent Sonoma site known for the variety. Tingling in acidity and yet offering structure and grace, it finishes clean and refreshing.',\n",
       " 'Complex and powerful, this wood-aged red has both elegance and density. Its black plum and blackberry fruits are spiced with an herbal character that gives an edge to the acidity in the aftertaste. Keep for 4–5 years.',\n",
       " \"Touches of smoke and grain extend throughout this uniquely savory off-dry kabinett. Rich streaks of peach and marmalade brighten the palate, accented by bursts of lemonade acidity, but overall, there's a bit of disarray throughout.\",\n",
       " 'Grassy aromas feature a note of green banana and yeast. This feels round but hardly chunky, with reasonable core acidity. Flavors of citrus and apple are simple and clean, while a lemon-lime note and a hint of honey take care of the ending.',\n",
       " \"The wine is all spice and ripe lychees, conveying a simple, fruity character that is rounded and medium sweet in character. It's ready to drink.\",\n",
       " \"Wood smoke and grilled meat aromas are prominent in this full-bodied, oaky wine. It doesn't have much varietal character but is savory, smoky and moderately tannic to sip.\",\n",
       " \"This barrel selection evokes the AVA's black-cherry fruit character nicely, keeping it lively and balanced, with excellent depth. Tasting the wine is like gazing into a deep pool; the flavors keep pushing further into the finish. Streaks of coffee and milk chocolate are in the mix, but it's the excellent fruit that captures your attention and holds it.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of flint, pressed rose petal, dark spice and a light balsamic note delicately lead the nose. The slim palate is vibrant and smooth, offering sour cherry, crushed herb and a smoky mineral note framed in bright acidity and taut, refined tannins. Drink 2017–2023.',\n",
       " 'Full bodied and complex, this is a fleshy Pinot Noir with fruit flavors that run from mulberry to spicy plum. Streaks of Dr. Pepper and some black pepper add finishing highlights.',\n",

       " 'Plump blackberries and ready-to-pop cherries are laced with touches of fresh tobacco, graphite and turned earth on this very well done Cab. The rich black plum fruit of the palate is cut by a strong acidity and firm tannic grip, with flavors of pencil lead keeping the wine serious and driven.',\n",
       " \"This interesting blend of Nero d'Avola and Pinot Nero (30%) recalls a California Pinot thanks to its rich color and density. You taste the purity of the berries but also get the heft and texture of a hot-climate red. Sweet candy and floral fragrances set the stage and the wine has a crisp, bright finish.\",\n",
       " 'A Chardonnay highly strung with green apple and lemon flavor, this wine evolves in the glass, deepening with fruit and minerality. The finish suggests vanilla. A good wine for creamy chicken and seafood meals.',\n",
       " \"This bottling is Bisquertt's first foray into the world of Pinot Noir. The wine smells like a wet dog, along with some candied, artificial fruit aromas. A chunky, sticky-feeling palate houses medicinal, green berry flavors, while the finish is oaky and remains medicinal and hot.\",\n",
       " 'Blackberry and cassis aromas are robust and typical for Toro. In the mouth, however, this is super tannic and like gravel. Dark berry flavors are well oaked, while the finish tastes of blackberry and chocolate but feels tannic as nails. Drink or hold; this will always be a rough wine.',\n",
       " 'Easy, slender and fresh, this bright Chianti (85% Sangiovese with Merlot) reveals green notes of olive and herb followed by wild berry and spice.',\n",
       " 'Fleshy, dense and bright with cassis and vanilla notes, this 100% varietal estate wine is lovely and elegantly restrained, showing compact oak and firm tannin. Raspberry, tobacco and cedar round out the nuanced flavors that open over time.',\n",
       " 'Extreme pepper elements, from peppercorn to bell pepper, carry through this entire experience. The nose also shows red berries, while the palate offers barely ripe strawberry notes. Fans of the peppery style, which often benefits from a slight chill, will be enthused. Those who hate pyrazines should stay away.',\n",
       " 'With each new vintage of Cuvée Elena, the blend of grapes and vineyards grows more complex, the vines older, the flavors more compact and captivating.

       " 'Opens with mild green, minty aromas that suggest tobacco, Middle Eastern spice and basic black fruit. The palate seizes control with grabby tannins and monolithic but unwavering grape and black-fruit flavors. Hard and tannic especially on the finish, with lingering lemony oak. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Monastrell and Tempranillo.',\n",
       " \"Whiffs of smoke and struck flint persist from nose to finish, lending dramatic minerality to this otherwise juicy, fruity Riesling. Sunny peach and tangerine flavors are semi-sweet on the palate, but it's a refreshing wine with a honed elegance throughout.\",\n",

       " 'This is one of a pair of premium off-dry Champagnes that are distinctive and bold. There is a tannic edge to this wine as well as plenty of red fruitiness and acidity. Because it is only just off dry, it will make a great pairing with savory spicy dishes.',\n",
       " 'Starts off with oaky, jammy aromas of cherries and raspberries, and tastes a little sweet in fruit pastry, with the baked crust. Seems a little one-dimensional, although that dimension is a very delicious one. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec.',\n",
       " 'This luminous Pinot Grigio offers sunny aromas of ripe peach, melon and pink grapefruit. The wine plays its cards well in the mouth too, thanks to its creamy but easygoing finish. Pair it with Chinese chicken salad.',\n",
       " \"Claret is the old British term for the wines of Bordeaux. This wine, the first such from Francis Ford Coppola's Sonoma County winery, is a good buy. It's a bit rustic, but offers smooth flavors of blackberries, currants and chocolate.\",\n",

There is concentration and a heady, seductive lemon and pear perfume hovering over the concentrated, profound palate of wet stone and immensely pure lemon oil. This comes on light, delicate feet but leaves you with a deep, lasting and impressive memory of Riesling purity and elegance.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of Spanish broom, honeysuckle and a yeasty note lead the nose of this Sicilian sparkler from Mount Etna. The palate offers ripe apple, candied citrus and bitter walnuts alongside persistent bubbles and zesty acidity.',\n",

       " 'Chocolate, cherry, spice and wood shavings are the leading aromas emitted from this hearty Cabernet Sauvignon. Despite its power, it is a beautiful wine with lasting herbal fragrances splashed over tight, firm tannins. This is a big, brawny wine that could overpower many foods, so pair it with grilled beef or roasts.',\n",
       " 'This ambitious effort stars flavors so ripe and fantastic, they defy description. The wine, with a few drops of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, explodes in blackberries, black cherries, currants, mocha, sweet licorice, plum and new oak flavors. The tannins are magnificent, the oak integration beautiful. The chief criticism is that the alcohol level is high, and gives the wine a burn of heat.',\n",
       " 'Pungent, high-pitched notes of turmeric and dried flower hit the nose first, with underlying scents of tobacco, char and cassis. The palate is medium bodied and chocolaty, and it bears chalky tannins that keep the finish firm.',\n",

       " \"This is a super cuvée from Bourseau with dense dark extracted tannins and concentrated fruits. It is rich, almost too rich, full of powerful fruits, black plum skins and a young firm structure. It will remain dry and tannic for several more years, so don't drink before 2020.\",\n",

       " 'An elegant, perfumed wine, showing great structured behind the rich mint and juicy black currant flavors. The wine has fine concentration, aging potential. It is accessible now, as with many Chinons, but equally this is a serious, dense wine for aging.',\n",
       " 'This wine seems to have a bit of everything. Lovely aromas of fresh cut grass mix with pear and melon on the nose while the palate offers some nice minerality and ends on a lingering peach note. Drink now to two years.',\n",
       " \"This famous site was planted in 1972 by Dick Erath, and the 44-year-old vines deliver an aromatic, elegant yet substantive bottle of Pinot. It's a complex mix of wild berries, cherries and chocolate, showing the generous flavors of the vintage. Delicious already, it's got the power and presence to age gracefully through 2023.\",\n",
       " \"An estate bottled Pinot, this wine is inviting in floral and fruity characteristics, offering concise layers of red cherry, rose petals and a spark of oak that builds in intensity through the finish. This is a nice place to start on the winery's lineup of Carneros-Napa Valley Pinot Noir.\",\n",
       " 'Faint notes of ripe pear rise from the glass. The palate comes in with fresh zestiness—it is dry and slender but has lip-smacking citrus freshness of grapefruit and tangerine. This is bundled, full of invigorating appetizing freshness. There is something bracingly clean but also harmonious about the finish.',\n",
       " 'This is rich and dry yet also fruity. Perfumed in character, it is full, soft and smooth, allowing the acidity a place on the finish.',\n",
       " 'A light, bright, deliciously lemony wine, with an attractive aromatic lift. Fruity, ready to drink now.',\n",
       " 'A fine wine, dry and bright in zesty acidity, and an excellent example of a tight, young Anderson Valley Pinot Noir. This shows flavors of sour cherry candy, persimmon and spice flavors, grounded with minerals. Drink now, with decanting, or age it for up to six years.',\n",
       " 'Oak, toast, espresso and dill aromas come together on this. The firm palate offers raw red cherry, vanilla and mocha framed in assertive, fine-grained tannins. A hint of raisin closes the finish.',\n",
       " \"A big, hard, dry Cabernet whose mountain tannins need quite some time to resolve. Right now they're tough as nails, although the blackberry fruit is so brilliant and intense, it punches right through. Give this dramatic wine at least six years, and it could well develop beyond the next decade.\",\n",
       " \"A stunning bottling from the Franscioni family, this shows exotic cinnamon, crystallized black-cherry juice, fresh black raspberry and graphite on the extremely elegant, soft and inviting nose. There's a tension between ripe black raspberry and everything else on the palate, from fennel and black pepper to black slate minerality. It's a seamless wine.\",\n",
       " \"The Roessler brothers take a good spin through the historic Sanford & Benedict vines and present a wine with cherry, baked fennel and a bit of eucalyptus on the nose. It's fairly lean once sipped, but balanced well between pomegranate fruit and dark spices.\",\n",
       " 'This brawny wine opens with subdued aromas that recall leafy underbrush, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of stewed plum. The warm, monolithic palate offers prune steeped in spirits, toasted nut, dark spice and a green note of powdered sage alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. The heat of evident alcohol on the close throws it further off-balance.',\n",
       " 'Ripe, fleshy black-fruit aromas suggest prune and raisin, while the palate is jammy and full, albeit one notch below precise and exact. Baked, oaky, charred flavors of meaty plum and blackberry finish with toasty overtones and modest heat. Drink through 2019.',\n",
       " 'On the lean, mineral side, this is a firm, extracted wine. It has a dry core that is masking the hints of juicy berry fruits. Give the wine a year to allow it to soften and drink from 2016.',\n",
       " 'This new project from the heights of Atlas Peak involves Steve Matthiasson as both viticulturist and winemaker, having had to take over the reins from the late Denis Malbec. It shines in bristling acidity, dusty tannin and a beautiful floral aroma of violet. Notes of chocolate, fig and cigar sit atop a pillowy, complex structure, while vanilla lingers on the finish.',\n",
       " 'A dry, light-bodied, easy-drinking Riesling, this has zesty lemon and grapefruit flavors, plus undertones of flower and spiced tangerine. The palate shows depth, and the finish is intense.',\n",
       " 'Cool mint, blueberry and raisin aromas are lush and smooth, but charred oak is roaring loud on the nose of this dry-farmed Syrah. Punchy, short acidity makes the mouthfeel abrupt. Dark chocolate and ripe berry flavors end with hard-spiced blackberry and an everlasting burnt-oak character.',\n",
       " 'Very bright and pure, with high acid that makes the wine clean and vibrant all the way through the finish, this Viognier bursts with tropical fruits, limes, wildflowers, honey and vanilla bean. Really easy to drink with a wide range of fare.',\n",
       " \"This Pinot is lovely for two reasons. One, it exhibits the tremendous balance and richness of a well-grown Santa Rita Hills Pinot. Secondly, the superb 2012 vintage makes it especially noteworthy. The raspberry and cherry fruit is ripe and fruity, and yet the finish is absolutely dry and complex. So good now, it's hard to recommend cellaring it, but you should, for up to eight years. A new brand from Margerum.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of 26% Roussanne, 25% Chardonnay, 19% Grenache Blanc, 17% Chenin Blanc and 13% Viognier, this is a complex and layered wine. A soft flinty character lies atop a rich bouquet of yellow apple, ripe green melon, tangerine and honeycomb. The medium-weight palate offers both weight and refinement, with a smooth texture and ripe fruit flavors that are cut by ample acidity and lingering sweet-spice accents. Drink now–2019.',\n",
       " 'Raspberry, blackberry and tobacco aromas settle in front of a chewy, round, solidly built palate. Medicinal berry flavors come with notes of rooty spice and resiny oak. A finely oaked finish holds root beer and dark-berry flavors that smoothly fade out. Drink through 2021.',\n",
       " 'A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.',\n",

       " 'Welcoming aromas of wood spice, plum and blackberry become more smoky with airing. This strong-boned RDD is pure and deep, with manageable tannins. Generous flavors of spiced blackberry, tobacco and vanilla finish long, elegant and with a lot in reserve. Drink from 2017 through 2030.',\n",
       " \"There's a strong herbal presence in the bouquet of this wine (bay leaves, clover) that marries well with the red plum and dried raspberry flavors. The mouth is smooth and creamy with a touch of tobacco spice lingering on the close. Drink now–2012.\",\n",
       " \"Redolent of dried cherries and violets, granite and slate, this late-release Merlot is already dropping elegant hints of its maturity. Concentrated with crisp black cherry flavor, it balances lavish texture alongside brisk acidity and minerality. The finish is long and meandering. It's delicious now, but sure to improve further from 2020 on.\",\n",
       " 'Rich blueberry aromas come with hints of cardamom, anise and lettuce leaf. The palate feels compact and dense, with reduction and modest acidity. Flavors of blueberry and baking spices finish firm, long and exotic, much like the nose.',\n",
       " 'From the winery that first popularized Petite Sirah in California, this vintage has vivid black-pepper aromas and a deep, inky color. Rich and concentrated flavors suggest pomegranate juice, blackberries and clove. Lavish and layered tannins give the texture an almost thick viscosity that coats the mouth for a lasting impression.',\n",
       " 'This is a crisply fruity wine, with tight acidity and a nervy texture. The citrus character dominates, leaving room for only hints of riper red fruits. The aftertaste continues the theme of crisp acidity.',\n",
       " \"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness. It's easy to like, a nice late afternoon cocktail sipper, and good with baked ham or pot stickers.\",\n",
       " 'Gritty, charred aromas rest on top of core blackberry and cassis scents. This is a blocky, stout number with firm tannins and serious structure. Charred blackberry and dark chocolate are the lead flavors, while this big-boned Toro tastes of toast and mocha on the finish, which is drying and tannic. Drink through 2027.',\n",
       " \"Here's a light and tonic expression of Nebbiolo (in a specially designed curvy bottle) with pretty aromas of wild berries, moist earth and forest floor. The color is a light and luminous ruby and the mouthfeel is equally streamlined and fresh. Firm tannins and intense flavors of smoke and cedar build momentum on the palate.\",\n",
       " 'A partially (50%) wood-fermented wine that shows a softer side to Fernão Pires, suppressing its natural exuberant freshness while adding complexity, spice and toast. The wine is worth aging a few months, so drink from early 2017.',\n",
       " \"Not yielding much now beyond hard tannins and primary fruit flavors of black currants that verge on raisins. But then, it's Petite Sirah, a known ager, and the acid-tannin balance suggests just that. Give it until 2012, at least.\",\n",
       " 'This wine offers immediate appeal, opening with aromas of black olive, funk, flowers and moist earth. It does not disappoint, with soft fruit and savory flavors that coat the palate. Meaty flavors add to the enjoyment and the balance is spot on.',\n",
       " \"Fans of Miguel Angel de Gregorio's Finca Allende wines from Rioja will want to snap up this excellent, lush-styled blend of Graciano, Merlot and Petit Verdot from La Mancha. This wine almost proves that talent is as important as terroir, because no other La Mancha wine features this grape blend, these rich and pure medicinal flavors, and a smooth-handed sense of balance that calls for drinking now through 2013.\",\n",
       " \"The home vineyard of Madiran's star, Alain Brumont, has yielded a superb wine that is full of dark tannins and with a considerable ability to age. It is balanced, concentrated and touched by spice and toastiness from the wood aging. In tandem with that are generous fruits within a dense structure that is just beginning to smooth out. Drink from 2018–2038.\",\n",
       " \"This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever.\",\n",
       " 'This wine leans toward the brown-orange side of the Pinot Noir scale, with burnt orange, cranberry and whiffs of anise. Cooked fruits dominate the palate, with fruitcake and gingerbread flavors.',\n",
       " 'This Chianti has a fragrance of berry with a whiff of violet. The palate is soft and offers plump black cherry and raspberry with a note of nutmeg and clove. Not much complexity but it has savory flavors. Drink soon with cured meats or pecorino cheese.',\n",

       " 'Young, supple and stylish, this mixes notes of berry, plum and cassis, demonstrating poise and richness. The barrel flavors are smoothly integrated; the finish is rich and dark, with a strong streak of cacao.',\n",
       " \"Rusty in color, with aromas of compost and rotten leaves, this isn't cutting it. A drawing hard palate and burnt-out flavors that match the nose make this a hard road to navigate.\",\n",
       " \"There aren't too many sparkling Pinot Grigios, but this is the one to try if you're curious. It offers substance and creaminess, with a subtle bouquet of citrus and stone fruit.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a fresh and tonic Prosecco with measured aromas of field flower, honey and stone fruit. The wine is light and lean in the mouth and washes easily over the palate with its fizzy effervescence. A bottle cap closure gives it a fun and informal twist.\",\n",
       " 'A bit stemmy, also a little underripe, with some minty, vegetal notes marring otherwise fine raspberries and cherries. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Just gorgeous, a wine to linger over with the finest food. Bone dry and crisp in acidity, it shows subtle flavors of sour cherry candy, persimmons and spices. Sweet, smoky oak is perfectly integrated. One of the best Pinot Noirs of the vintage in this price range and a comparative bargain.',\n",
       " \"This ruby-colored blend of Corvina and Sangiovese doesn't offer huge aromatic intensity, but it does deliver clean notes of cherry, dried fruit, spice and fresh tobacco leaf (it is aged in cherry wood casks). The wine imparts a sour note with nutty, earthy flavors on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'A Spanish grape variety produced this temptingly smooth, polished but earthy-flavored wine. It smells like new leather, seems young and still leesy and tastes deliciously fruity and supple. A bit decadent, it carries a long finish.',\n",
       " \"Regional pioneer Rick Longoria delivers a savory, earthy wine from the vineyard he planted, with meaty aromas of shiitake and porcini mushrooms, black slate, cedar and fresh pomegranate. The palate is more reliant on peppery spice, rose-petal florals and dried herbs than fruit, though dried cherries make an appearance, especially on the lasting finish. It's great now, but will thrive for at least a decade. Drink 2018–2028.\",\n",
       " 'Off dry, fizzy and fresh, this is a classic crisp and clean Vinho Verde, based on the Loureiro grape. It is light and bright with lemon and sugar water flavors, and is ready to drink now.',\n",
       " \"In line with this winery's penchant for oak, this fast-aging wine is buttery and heavily toasted. As a result, snappy apple or citrus fruit is harder to find than many might want it to be. Nevertheless, there's some bold lemon and creamy vanilla on the thick, mouthfilling palate. And for that, it earns points.\",\n",
       " \"Aromas of canned peaches and apricots are about all one can pull from the bouquet. It feels solid and untamed, with juicy flavors that run straight to mango, Dole peach and sweetened papaya. It's short on character and complexity but big on sweet, sticky flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Nuarè is a bright and cheerful Pinot Noir with fruit sourced from northern Italy that shows pretty nuances of forest berry and blue flower. The mouthfeel is lean and compact but the low price is one of this wine's biggest selling points.\",\n",
       " 'Kreuth is a sophisticated, oak-aged Chard from the mountainous north of Italy that delivers a creamy, rich structure and beautiful aromas of pineapple, mature peach, honey and almond. The wine is dense and satisfying and would pair with roasted artichoke or lime marinated chicken with cilantro.',\n",
       " 'This is solid, rich and with great fruit flavors to complement its structure. Red cherry fruitiness is lifted by intense acidity and broadened by the dark tannins and concentration. This is a wine to age for a few years, so drink after 2015.',\n",
       " \"This bottling is a great representation of the savory style that's typical of the Santa Cruz Mountains, but with enough rounded, approachable ripeness that it will appease those seeking juicier wine as well. Aromas of blackberry, blueberry, spicy vanilla and sharp cinnamon-allspice lead into a black and white pepper-laden palate, full of ripe elderberry, blueberry and elderflower.\",\n",
       " \"A terrific expression of its appellation, the 2007 La Dame Rousse from Domaine de la Mordorée starts off a bit tight and minerally on the nose, then explodes on the palate with layers of cherries, peaches, warm stones and dried spices. It's full-bodied and rich, with a long, spice-driven finish. Treat it like a light red, serving it with charcuterie or simple grilled meats, and drink it over the next year or so.\",\n",

       " 'Barrel fermented and aged in 60% new French oak, this wine shows a pleasing mixture of fruit and barrel, intermingling aromas of toast, stone and tropical fruit, spice and butter. Flavors are light and elegant, but show a pleasing sense of balance.',\n",
       " \"This complex, flavorful wine walks on the wild side with a bit of funky barnyard in the aromas and flavors. It's dry, moderately tannic, rather light in body, and brings spicy black pepper, grilled beef and ripe plum flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Smoky and herbal upfront, this is a light-bodied wine with silky-soft tannins. The flavors are on the savory side, ranging from hickory smoke and hung game to dried mint and thyme. Worth trying with roasted or braised lamb.',\n",
       " 'Honeysuckle notes hover over ripe pears. The palate boosts these notions even more with some residual sweetness that enhances the fruitiness. Edged with pleasant pithiness, the finish is off dry but balanced.',\n",

       " 'Lightly herbal, spicy aromas of tobacco, forest floor, juniper and pepper accent core blackberry, cassis and cherry aromas. This Cabernet is tight and mildly tannic, but not fierce or demanding. Ripe blackberry, coffee, mocha and vanilla flavors finish spicy, toasty and oaky. Drink through 2020.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of plum, savory herb, leather and hint of baking spice lead the nose. On the palate, notes of vanilla, espresso and toast add depth to the juicy, black cherry core. Round tannins make this already accessible; enjoy through 2018.',\n",

       " \"While the wine is structured, it does also have plenty of ripe, juicy fruitiness that is already delicious. It's an open wine, rounded and rich in fruit flavor. The tannins are likely to smooth out soon, so drink from 2016.\",\n",
       " 'Cedar aromas and raisin and prune flavors are bold in this full-bodied, fresh but rather rustic wine.',\n",
       " 'Blueberries and blackberries are the dominant themes here, with some smoky notes playing a supporting role. Bright, tart and fruity, this doesn’t appear to have the depth for aging. But it is an immensely attractive wine for early quaffing. There are some slightly drying tannins on the finish, so try it with rich or fatty foods for best effect.',\n",
       " 'This reserve spends 30 months in barrel. It has lovely aromatics, with subtle suggestions of tobacco and clove woven through the base of ripe black cherry and cassis. The tannins are polished, and the finish lends a thread of iron.',\n",
       " 'Barolo Cerretta is a cheerful and friendly wine with defined aromas of cherry, wild berry, dusty mineral, bright spice, root beer and ground ginger. This wine is built to last and will age gracefully ten years or more.',\n",
       " 'This Cabernet-Monastrell blend tips the scales at 15.5% and asks you straight out: how big do you like your red wines? It is smoky, sultry and massive, with spicy boysenberry aromas, a deep, syrupy palate and plodding flavors of molasses, roasted berry, cedar plank and herbs. Bullish but drinkble now and over the next few years; probably not one for the cellar.',\n",
       " \"This is a very pale Pinot Noir—you can almost read through it. It's also light and simple in texture, with some polished flavors of raspberries, Dr. Pepper and spices. It finishes dry and crisp in acidity.\",\n",

Flavors of currant, plum and cherry run deep, while the finish is presently youthful, grabby and drawing, with a slight note of raisin. Drink through 2032.',\n",
       " 'Among all the 2011 single vineyard Pinots from Ken Wright, the Carter was the most difficult to assess. It showed reductive scents and remained stubbornly closed despite all efforts to give it a chance to open. Tight cranberry and cherry fruit peeked through a hard shell.',\n",
       " \"Kason's Barrel Select brings a lot of muscle and weight for the price. The fruit is packed and powerful, a mélange of cherries, plums and spice. It's a bit sharp and high-toned, nicely balanced, and persistent, with a peppery finish.\",\n",
       " \"Blended with 10% Syrah, this is a voluptuous, rich wine, dry and full-bodied. It has blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, bacon and sweet oak flavors. Clearly the winery's best, albeit most expensive Cabernet ever, it's gorgeous to drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Rheingraf's 2010s look to be terrific, and this bottling, from old vines, starts fast. Mouthwatering notes of honey, truffle and petrichor emerge, followed by a wine that's plush and mouthfilling yet structured; ripe yet crisp. Drink now–2020.\",\n",
       " \"This is a new dessert wine from Bonny Doon, from the Arroyo Seco region which is such a great source of whites. With 11% residual sugar, it's quite sweet. The apricot, peach, pear and lime flavors have a honeyed, botrytised richness.\",\n",
       " 'Slightly herbal plum and berry aromas come with a pinch of spice and meatiness. Feels medium-bodied and crisp, with juicy red-fruit flavors of plum, tomato and raspberry. Dries out on the finish, where it becomes more herbal and roasted.',\n",
       " \"Like an ugly duckling that's a beautiful swan in waiting, this unique rosé, if you can call it that given its rusty, almost brown color, is something only Terroir Al Limít would bottle. Earthy in aromas, this mix of several Grenache strains tastes of apricot and dried red fruits. It's mildly spicy throughout, with actual tannins from skin contact. Drink this quasi rosé as you would a serious white or red, meaning with good food like a Catalan-style rice dish. And drink now.\",\n",
       " 'This wine is dominated by darkness, giving aromas of upturned black earth and coffee grinds. The palate trends a tad redder, with lava rocks, but the blackness returns in the form of blueberries, espresso and soil.',\n",
       " 'Light and cheesy smelling, this has herbal red-fruit aromas. It feels quick and hard across the palate, with strawberry, raspberry and herbal flavors.',\n",
       " 'Much in the style of Leonetti Cabernet, with the richness of Napa Valley fruit, this deeply satisfying, superripe wine is 100% varietal. Notes of cassis, fig and a hint of prune are swathed in deeper flavors of espresso and dark chocolate.',\n",
       " 'Lovely notes of Golden Pearmain apple perfume the nose, with hints of soy sauce. The body and palate are luminous showing green apple freshness that come across as light, graceful and authentic. There is something honest and fresh-faced about this wine that is rather disarming. This is a very beautiful, classy crémant made from a blend of Riesling and Auxerrois.',\n",
       " 'Right now this Pinot is a bit heavy and full-bodied, almost like a Rhône-style wine with its thick mouthfeel and cherry, anise and chocolate flavors. It could easily age, throwing some sediment and becoming softer and more delicate. Try after 2012.',\n",
       " 'The Sangiovese comes from Red Willow Vineyard, and it would be hard to find a more lovely, elegant rosé from this side of the Atlantic. Light strawberry and melon aromas continue onto the palate, with pinpoint detail and precision.',\n",
       " 'Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak.',\n",
       " 'This eight-year old wine, based on Touriga Nacional, is ripe, now mature with the tannins fully integrated into the rich black fruit. It is firm with a structure that gives concentration and perfumed acidity. The wine is still dark and dense although ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'Crisp, bright and delicious, this has pure red fruit, with an herb note, intense acidity and a tangy texture.',\n",
       " 'One of the best Californian Pinot Gris currently available, this is rich, creamy and complex, and it would make for a great alternative to Chardonnay. This wine traditionally ages in used oak, which imparts just a hint of wood-driven sweetness to the pear, peach, mango and lime flavors.',\n",
       " 'This is a first for Forgeron, pure Sangiovese, sourced entirely from the Boushey vineyard. A soft, plummy entry spreads lushly across the palate, with flavors of ripe raspberries and strawberries. The acids have a sharp edge and a slight perception of chalk, while the finish turns further in that direction, with a hint of milk chocolate.',\n",
       " 'This Vignobles Dourthe wine is ripe and richly textured. Full and blackberry flavored, it is 84% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. An attractive interplay between the fruit and the tannins gives a balanced wine. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       " 'The aromas bring notes of vanilla, cream and baking spice, with the oak playing a prominent part but still showing appeal. The palate brings sweet cinnamon flavors that linger on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, forest berry and Alpine herb take center stage in this elegant and structured red. The vibrant palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry compote, star anise and tobacco hints alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Impeccably balanced and delicious, it also offers incredible value. Drink through 2029.',\n",
       " 'This release deserves some sort of award for consistency, year in and year out. The 2011 is light to medium in body and long, zesty and vibrant on the finish. Aromas and flavors of bergamot, honey (although the wine is completely dry) and toast are classic aged Eden Valley Riesling. Drink now–2030.',\n",
       " 'A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla. With medium tannins and moderate acidity, the wine shows no ill effects of the broiling 2003 vintage. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Tarry aromas of blackberry and freshly applied asphalt set up a full-bodied palate with sandpaper tannins. Blackberry and toast flavors taste a little burnt, while an oak-based blackened element is present on a stout finish. Drink this blocky and lusty Malbec through 2023.',\n",
       " 'This pale copper rosé blends 71% Shiraz with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Sangiovese. Melon, stone fruit and citrus notes feature on the broad palate that comes into crisp focus on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'This tight wine lacks fruit. Touches of apple and citrus are lost in the austere texture. No artificial yeasts were used during vinification in stainless steel and large oak barrels.',\n",
       " 'Varietally funky, light in color and straightforward in approach, this still-young wine has structured tannins that persist on the palate, nearly chewy but starting to find their groove. Orange and cinnamon are dominant characteristics.',\n",
       " 'Ripe, earthy aromas of prune, blackberry, baking spices and barnyard set up a rich yet balanced palate with mild tannins and integrated acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and hoisin sauce end with meaty, spicy notes akin to barbecued ribs. Drink now through 2022.',\n",
       " 'A hint of mossy undergrowth leads on the nose, while lovely notes of white-pepper dusted green and yellow pear unfold on the soft, rounded palate. Those looking for texture as well as flavor will not be disappointed. Those who have the patience to cellar this will be rewarded with complex, mature flavors and great concentration. Drink 2016–2020.',\n",
       " 'Chunky stone-fruit aromas are ripe, mature and indicative that this Chardonnay is about to start fading. Heavy, honeyed flavors of nectarine and apple finish with a note of oxidation, mild barrel spice and just enough acidity to maintain balance. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Elegant mineral, citrus and spice aromas lead into complex layers of sea salt and lemon flavors. Overall this is balanced, but with a bracing edge that's refreshing and refined.\",\n",
       " \"They used wild yeasts to ferment this Chard, and there is something exotic and feral about the flavors, which go beyond nectarines and pears into fruits without names. It's missing some crispness, but shows richness and opulence.\",\n",
       " 'This is a new wine brand from Muxagat. It shows a strong, perfumed character along with tight minerality. Bitter chocolate suggests some extraction, giving a wine with firm structure. At the same time, the juicy black currant fruits are deliciously ripe and rich. Drink this wine from 2016.',\n",
       " 'Red cherry, kola nut, root beer, brown spice and a touch of smoke pull the nose deeply into this bottling by Blair Fox and Eli Parker. Baked red and black plum, a touch of mulberry and bloody, earthy flavors mark the palate, which is quite complex and bound together with a strong tannic structure.',\n",
       " \"While low in alcohol and austere in dryness, there's a remarkable richness of texture that lends an impression of volume and density on the palate. Brisk notes of lemon and tart tangerine shine brightly, but are juxtaposed by an intensely stony, mineral finish. Drink now through 2020.\",\n",
       " 'Nice and dry, with brisk acidity framing pineapple, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, boosted with a touch of smoky oak.',\n",
       " 'The valley is in a remote, warm part of Napa County. The wine is quite good. Rich and softly opulent, it offers waves of red cherry, raspberry, chocolate, orange tea, anise and Asian spice flavors that go on and on. Not an ager, but delicious now and through 2011 or so.',\n",
       " 'Sea salt and lemon rind start this refreshing white. Flavors of citrus, mineral and brine on the finish are balanced and bright. A lovely wine and a great pairing for grilled octopus, sushi or poultry.',\n",
       " \"Loads of plum, dark chocolate, blackberry and exotic spices in this big, dry wine. Oak, too, in the form of exquisite vanilla and caramel. It's absolutely delicious, but maybe a little one-dimensional, showing that Petit Verdot by itself needs some help from other varieties.\",\n",
       " 'This structured wine is young, with a firm character that is still masking the juicy red fruits. However, it does have weight and the potential for a soft, rounded wine in a couple of years. Drink this wine, from a small region just north of Pouilly Fumé, from 2016.',\n",
       " 'This Roero offers very good intensity of aromas that are characterized by layers of white cherry, wild berry and exotic spice. The wine offers a soft, velvety feel in the mouth although those tight tannins definitely appear on the close.',\n",
       " \"Aged in older American and French oak barrels for approximately one year, this lacks the fruit to stand up to the bitter tannins. It's green and short, with little fruit flavor.\",\n",
       " 'A meaty, gamy Syrah boasting aromas of bacon and duck-liver mousse, this wine delivers tremendous flavor and quality for the price. It offers plenty of body around a core of plush, savory tannins and a long finish of pepper and cinnamon spice. Start slicing the charcuterie.',\n",
       " \"This is a soft wine, ripe with lime and grapefruit flavors that are sweetened with juicy red apple. It's tangy as well, laced with orange zest and filled with steely acidity. It should age a few months, so drink from late 2015.\",\n",
       " \"For the first time, this release of Buty's Rediviva, from estate vineyards in the Rocks region of Walla Walla, includes a bit of Mourvèdre. The pretty fruit flavors of strawberry preserves, blueberry and black cherry carry both a mineral underpinning and a whiff of the barnyard in the nose. The aging in mostly neutral puncheons and barrels adds just a hint of baking spices.\",\n",
       " \"The aromas on this wine are surprisingly blue fruited for a Cabernet, followed by notes of herb, green pepper and spice. The flavors are lightly sweet, followed by a spice-filled finish. It's a straightforward quaffer that doesn't quite show its variety.\",\n",
       " \"Full roasted-plum aromas outweigh any nuance the nose might hold, while this is medium to full in body, with enough viscosity. Flavors of spicy cherry and plum are barrel-driven, with notes of clove and cinnamon backing the wine's fruit. A finish based on toasty oak serves this well.\",\n",
       " 'Among Chilean Chardonnays, this one gets it more right than wrong. The nose deals apple pie and mineral, while the palate shows mostly apple, pear and butterscotch flavors. Not complex or stately, but round, fresh and generally on target.',\n",
       " \"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the rest Sémillon, this attractive white wine has an appealing snap to the fruit and an underlying acidity that sets it up in lively fashion. It's a food wine through and through, lightly toasty, with green berries and apples providing the clean fruit flavors. A fine value.\",\n",
       " 'Gritty initial aromas of coffee grinds, balsamic vinegar and sassy berry fruits open this Cabernet-led blend that includes Petit Verdot, Carmenère and Cabernet Franc. Blackened flavors of berry fruits are offset by spice, olive and herbal notes. On the finish, oaky spice and modest acidity are lasting. Drink through 2020.',\n",
       " \"Spicy saucy red-berry aromas announce a flush palate that's more balanced than outright bullish. Flavors of wild berry, nutmeg, vanilla and chocolate finish lively, with good weight. Drink this delicious Reserva through 2019.\",\n",
       " \"The Attaché brings appealing and lively cherry fruit, framed with citrusy acidity. The power in this wine is all forward and fruit-driven. It's quite good, but more for immediate drinking than cellaring.\",\n",
       " \"Such are the tannins in this 100% Cab that it demands cellar time. It's really shut down and astringent in youth, which emphasizes the dryness. But it's very fine, with a solid core of ripe black cherry fruit that will express its sweetness when the tannins melt away. Winemaker Amy Aiken is really showing her stuff with this polished ager. Best 2013–2019.\",\n",
       " 'Brooding notes of black, crunchy cherry along with wood smoke and fir rise from the glass. On the palate there is a vein of tart, lively freshness that draws earthy smoke and full fruit notes towards the core, leaving shadows of smoke and fir, cherry, blueberry and white pepper around the fringes. Freshness is far more of a defining factor than silky tannins. This is authentic, unforced and very fresh.',\n",
       " 'Pungent orange blossom and jasmine aromas show on the extremely floral nose of this bottling, which almost smells sweet. But the palate is dry with very vibrant acidity and a lot of interesting texture, showing ripe apple and pear flavors.',\n",
       " 'This ripe rich wood-aged blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon is full of juicy berry fruits and plenty of acidity. The wine is full bodied, poised and ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'Like other wines in the Fronteira range, this is certainly powerful. It is also ripely smooth, its dark tannins wrapped in a velvet, dusty texture and ripe plum juice fruits. Important, complex wine.',\n",
       " 'Oak dominates this wine, with buttered toast and caramel flavors overwhelming the underlying orange, lemon and peach flavors.',\n",
       " 'Orange rind and Chinese spices make for an intriguing opener but the palate falls flat, with little to offer but a few simple lemon and lime flavors. Short finish.',\n",
       " \"There are strongly spicy aromas to this gentle Gewurztraminer. It's off dry, keeping some acidity amid the ripe lychee and nutmeg flavors. It's an approachable wine, ready to drink now.\",\n",
       " 'White pepper aroma. Subtle blackberry fruit reveals itself on the palate, as do some tough tannins. Very dry, with an earthy, tannic finish. Needs a few years to soften up.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of toast, coconut and oak-driven spice lead the nose and carry over to the palate along with licorice and a confectionary note. This lacks fruit richness while raspy tannins leave an astringent finish.',\n",
       " \"One of Italy's most interesting and least-know wines, Sforzato di Valetellina is made with dried Nebbiolo grapes in much the same way Amarone is made. In fact, sforzato means “forced” in Italian and alludes to the extra concentration given to the wine. With herbal and some bitter, leafy green notes, it's not a wine for everyone; it's sour in the mouth with an acid-driven close.\",\n",
       " 'Mouthwatering, high-toned acidity and a pleasant lemon-lime bitterness keeps the honeyed apple characteristics of this semisweet style Riesling in balance. Elegant mineral and petrol notes lead to a lingering, puckery finish.',\n",
       " \"A gently perfumed wine, it has ripe, juicy black-fruit flavors and a backing of tannins. It's balanced with the dry core surrounded by rich fruitiness and a burst of final acidity. It could be drunk now, but will be better from 2016.\",\n",
       " 'This is a soft, tart, light red wine with excessive volatility. The finish borders on vinegary flavors, which overtake the fruit.',\n",
       " 'Cabreo is a bulldozer of a wine with brawny power, solid dimension and hearty aromas of smoked bacon, black ink, tar and chocolate fudge. The blend is 70-30 Sangiovese and Cabernet and the dense concentration achieved with these two grapes is remarkable.',\n",
       " 'This LBV Port is powered by jammy damson and plum fruits along with dried figs and a juicy aftertaste. The palate is dry, with tannins just in evidence, although the balance is just right. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This wine has such nice hickory, dried-spice and red-berry notes, it'd be a shame to drink it anywhere but outside on your deck, with some slow-cooked baby back ribs. Medium-weight, with some chalky tannins, it finishes with more of the same flavors, plus some char and green herb. Fire up the grill. Best Buy.\",\n",
       " 'Tiny amounts of Zinfandel and Malbec are added to this wine, which otherwise delivers varietally appropriate notes of tart cranberry and black currant. From there, leather comes onto the palate, bolstering an already heady mix of tannin and oak, finishing rich in tobacco and dark chocolate.',\n",
       " 'Classic Monterey Pinot, dry, crisp, silky and ripe. The fine 2007 vintage has made it explosive in cherries, currants, sassafras and cola, with refined, new oak notes of smoke and spice. Drink this rich wine now through 2013.',\n",
       " \"Not quite as big as the Bâtard, Latour's Corton-Charlie is the house's flagship (the company owns 10 hectares of the grand cru) and most ageable wine. The 2000 boasts aromas of gunflint, pear, smoked meat and buttered toast. White peaches emerge on the palate, but the primary flavors are of minerals and spice. Finishes with tons of citrus and an almost tannic feel. Give it two or three years to begin to soften.\",\n",
       " 'A soft, lightly floral wine, with an oily texture, the ripe pear and apricot fruits edged with citrus. A hint of walnuts goes with the final acidity.',\n",
       " 'This is dark and firm, with sufficient fruit to promise a rich future. The wine has ample weight, a solid, dense core and a juicy outer layer. Good for 3–5 years.',\n",
       " 'A lifted, phenolic note of Bosc pear peel suggests both freshness and maturity. The soft, rounded palate sings with pear sweetness and finishes medium-dry. There is softness and pliability, but a guiding, focused freshness that provides excellent balance.',\n",
       " 'Flowery and balanced in crisp, dry flavors of lemon and pear, this wine takes its designation from the French word for fog, a nod to its cool-climate environs. Supple tannins and refined acidity round out the deal.',\n",
       " 'Very dry and dusty, this blend of Carricante and Catarratto does a great job of showing the volcanic characteristics of Mt. Etna. There is fruit in the form of citrus, pear and melon, and the wine presents a tangy grapefruit finish, with a pretty mineral nuance as well.',\n",
       " 'This is a rich, round and full-bodied wine with smooth, creamy apple and pear flavors. It is cut through with zingy lemon acidity and a touch of honey. The structure comes from a cool line of lemon zest, minerality and a tight, taut aftertaste. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       " 'Pretty fierce in acidity, but flavorful enough, with plenty of raspberry and cherry jam, accented with cola and spices. Drink now, after decanting.',\n",
       " \"This outstanding vineyard has a certain signature of Asian spices that comes through in its own wines as well as those made by other producers. Sappy red fruits and some high-toned bourbon-barrel highlights are at the core. There are additional notes of sassafras and sandalwood, along with those lovely Asian spices. It's a thick, full throttle, mouth-coating wine.\",\n",
       " 'Enticing aromas of violet, dark-skinned berry, chopped herb and clove lead the nose while the vibrant palate offers wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice and a hint of ground pepper. Polished tannins support the savory flavors.',\n",
       " 'The organic wine has tight tannins and acidity. The structure is balanced by red-currant fruit flavors. The wine is vinified under the direction of Michel Rolland and one of several family wineries under Bacchus Investments. Drink from 2018.',\n",
       " 'Rooty berry aromas vie for attention with molasses, graphite and earth notes. This Toro is stout and creamy in feel, with bracing acidity and firm tannins. Baking spice, roasted black-fruit and molasses flavors are typically ripe, while the finish is hot, with punchy acidity. Drink through 2020.',\n",
       " 'This 100% varietal wine delivers mineral, citrus twist, raw meat, raspberry and black pepper notes. The palate is full bodied and packed to the brim with fruit and savory flavors. It brings a seamlessness and length that are absolutely dazzling.',\n",
       " 'Disappointing, but perhaps this is just past its best? Scallion and green veggies nearly swamp nectarine fruit in this medium-bodied wine.',\n",
       " 'This bottling from a region northeast of San Diego is almost austere at first, but then restrained aromas of candied nuts and ripe pears show on the nose. The palate is also well-restrained for this often unctuous grape, especially coming from a warmer region, with flavors of kaffir lime, citrus pith, nectarine, melon and guava.',\n",
       " \"Consistently one of the best of Sparkling Pointe's many excellent offerings, this elegant wine shows classic expressions of apple and lemon juxtaposed with complex notes of fresh-baked brioche, nuts and cream. High-toned acidity and fine, delicate mousse fill the palate with intensity and harmony. The finish lingers exceptionally long.\",\n",
       " \"The best vintage to date for this wine, delivering sharp well-defined varietal character. It's tight, tart and focused, mixing lemon, orange and cherry fruit with a well-built finish. No new oak, just half neutral and half twice-used barrels, but the highlights of toast and mocha latte add a nice touch to the tannins.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of Shiraz and Castelão is in a soft and ripe rosé style. There is just a touch of tannin from the Shiraz to give weight. The aftertaste is lightly sweet.',\n",

       " 'One in a range of wines under the Xavier Flouret brand, this wine is made by Domaine Hamelin in Chablis. It is deliciously refreshing, with just the right edge of crispness to give it a lift. At the same time, its ripe, creamy texture blends with spiced-apple fruitiness. Drink the wine now.',\n",
       " 'This black wine, despite being almost seven years old, remains rich and balanced on the nose, where ripe aromas of raisin and earth offer a slight herbal, minty edge. The mouthfeel is 100% thick and jammy, while flavors of prune, baked blackberry and chocolate lead to a chewy finish. This blend of Malbec, Merlot and Tannat is a knife-and-fork wine to drink now.',\n",
       " 'This opens green and herbal, with a disconnected mix of unripe and grapy fruit flavors. The new barrel aging brings toast and butter, but behind that the wine is still disjointed and the fruit flavors all up front.',\n",

       " 'Sweet aromas of orange blossoms and honey emerge from this bottling, along with a more nuanced sense of quinine and botanicals. The sip is drier than expected yet still a tad sweet, with rounded orange cream, lemon peel and dried white-peach flavors.',\n",
       " \"Opens with funky aromas of sweaty leather and cheese that seem rustic for this bodega. Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice. Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades. Not the best Sierra Cantabria high-end wine I've tried but still shows excellence once it finds its stride. Drink from 2015–2025.\",\n",
       " 'This is a plush and upfront wine that offers succulent aromas of cherry, black fruit and plum. It glides clean down the palate thanks to its thick density and soft, smooth texture. The wine has the pulp and density to pair with most winter foods.',\n",
       " 'Plum and blackberry aromas dominate a fruit-forward nose with palpable oak and toast. This is rock-solid and firm on the palate. Ripe flavors of baked black fruits are darkened by toast and chocolate notes. On the finish, this tastes of fig and peppery spice. Drink through 2023.',\n",
       " 'Light, clear and crisp, this extremely light-bodied wine combines fruit from various vineyards and clones, and offers a suggestion of cranberry and pomegranate. Earthy, with an edge of forest and tea, it finishes plainly.',\n",

       " \"The golden color suggests evolution and the nose does not disappoint, presenting lifted notes of petrol, saffron, candied lemon and mandarin. Rich sweetness on the palate pairs with 2010's laser-sharp acidity, becoming more honeyed with each moment. This acidity still rings with greengage and lime freshness, providing lift. In the middle of its evolution, the wine is developed but still has potential. Drink now–2026.\",\n",
       " \"Salted peach, vanilla-smeared French toast and a hint of guava make for a very powerful aromatic impression on this wine from the Arroyo Grande appellation at the southern end of San Luis Obispo County. Those scents don't exactly translate to the palate, though, where the wine it a bit leaner than promised, with apple pie flavors the most dominant.\",\n",

Similar key lime flavors show on the palate as does freshly squeezed pear juice, which offers a ripe, rounded character.',\n",
       " 'Jammy, earthy, chocolaty blackberry aromas come with a minerally note of vitamins and grit. This is bold and lively on the palate, with black plum, brandied cherry, herb and charred-oak flavors. Burnt toast and blackened berry flavors finish woody, chocolaty and lemony.',\n",
       " 'After a leafy, somewhat burnt opening that seems muddled, things fall into place. The palate has a chewy, tannic, staunch feel that frames earthy berry, mocha, brown sugar and stewed plum flavors. It gets better and better as it unfolds, with prune and kirsch notes on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Floral and fruity smelling, this also has notes of dry earth and asphalt. It feels tangy and tomatoey, with saucy flavors of red cherry, tomato and herbs. The finish is herbal, with flavors of oregano and rosemary amplified by zingy acidity.',\n",
       " \"This is all Pommard clone, with a tart racy mix of cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's juicy and young, with sharp, precise edges. Tannins remain slightly bitter, but a couple more years in bottle should fix that.\",\n",
       " 'A strong earthiness greets the nose on this appellation blend. Turned loam and black dirt show first, followed by cocoa, cran-raspberry and vanilla bean. The earth shows on the palate too, with juniper, pepper, rhubarb and rose petals balanced by a orange-rind bitterness.',\n",

       " 'Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 2017–2022.',\n",

       " 'Bright in cherry and cranberry, this classically styled Nebbiolo is light red in color and buoyant in acidity. A sanguine back layer brings the earthier elements of the wine to life. With not much Nebbiolo to try in California, this one is worth a taste to savor the possibilities.',\n",
       " \"Vivid, fresh apple aromas and flavors plus light banana and butter notes and a tangy but rich texture make this medium-bodied, Rhône-style wine more than simple refreshment.

       " \"Like all of Alta Vista's single-vineyard Malbecs, this is opaque in color and ripe on the nose. Aromas of balsamic-coated raisin, black cherry and chocolate scream ripe and rich.

       " 'As this is tight and currently aloof, it lacks the generosity of the 2009 vintage, but it may prove to be more ageable. It has deep, earthy flavors of red currant, cola and balsam, and it could blossom into something even more complex after 2016.',\n",

       " \"Cab Franc makes a strong case for being top gun among this region's reds. This estate-grown example has been vinified for aromatics, elegance, balance and detail, and succeeds beautifully. Juicy boysenberry and blueberry fruit is buoyed with ample acidity. The flavors penetrate through a clean, crisp, lingering finish. Just 60 cases were exported to the U.S.\",\n",
       " 'Kungfu Girl has become an iconic Riesling on the strength of its instantly recognizable label, and surpassing quality. At 11% alcohol and 18 g/L residual sugar, it rests comfortably on the fence between dry and off-dry, and is a bulls-eye rendition of Washington Riesling.

       " 'Slightly leafy and damp on the nose, but dense. The palate is solid, with dark cherry and raspberry flavors along with herbal, drying notes and a touch of late bitterness. Spicy late, with coffee on the finish. Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Shiraz is the blend.',\n",
       " \"There's a good wine in here, but it needs some time to escape the cage of hard tannins and primary fruit. Floods the mouth with blackberry pie, crème de cassis and sweet, vanilla oak flavors that are just itching for a good 5–7 years in the cellar.\",\n",

       " \"100% Merlot from Hedges North Block on Red Mountain. It's light, spicy and simple, without the muscle and verve of the state's best Merlots. The fruit is forward, crisply defined, and tastes like fresh raspberries, with some sharp-edged tannins.\",\n",
       " 'Elvio Cogno and his son-in-law have worked tirelessly since 1990 to uncover the best expressions of Nebbiolo from their hillside vineyards.

Drink now through 2022.\",\n",

       " '. A delightfully intriguing “White Burgundy” blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Meunier, the last an unexpected surprise, the fruit sourced from both the Sangiacomo and Yountmill vineyards. The wine is light and yet lush, with an inviting nose of sweet apricot and apple pie, and a roundness to the mouthfeel. This would pair nicely with a buttery halibut but also stand well on its own as an apéritif.',\n",
       " 'Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from tech power couple T.J. and Valeta Rodgers offers rich aromas of dried Mission fig, elderberry and black cherry, along with clay, loam and purple flowers.

       " \"Dense and meaty like a baked purple leather pouch, this is tightly tannic, with a lift of acidity on the midpalate and a hint of violet struggling to get out. It's an interesting wine; give it 3–5 years in the cellar or drink now with red meat.\",\n",
       " 'Lightly honeyed, this off-dry wine is complex while also fruity. Intense flavor fills the mouth with spice, yellow fruits, pineapple and a touch of mango. The fruits are balanced by the more nuanced honey and spice character that is finished with acidity. Gros Manseng, a native grape of this region, is worth getting to know. Drink this delicious wine from 2016.',\n",
       " \"Intensely concentrated and nuanced with oak, spice and citrus rind, there's a whole lot more than insipid quaffing in store for this Pinot Grigio. Lithe, lean and deeply mineral in style, it's a wine meant for slow sipping and pondering.\",\n",
       " 'The winemaking has a slightly Australian flavor, aging primarily in American oak and going into barrel while still fermenting, resulting in a fairly soft wine with good intensity and varietal character. Some slightly smoky, earthy notes and cured meat aromas give way to blackberry and cola flavors on the palate, finishing up with a hint of coffee. Drink now–2015.',\n",

       " 'A neutral nose announces a fresh but basic palate with briny flavors of citrus, white pepper and bell pepper. A chalky, dry finish is juicy but lacks depth.',\n",
       " 'The silky texture is delightful, giving it the lightness desirable in Pinot Noir. Santa Lucia acidity gives a bright edge to the cherry, cola, pomegranate and heirloom tomato flavors. Drink now–2014 for maximum freshness.',\n",
       " \"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.\",\n",
       " 'This is a full, ripe wine. It has red fruits, black currants and a rich seam of tannins. There is also a smoky character that adds attraction. With a ripe aftertaste, the wine is developing well and should be ready from 2018.',\n",
       " \"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and several other varieties defines the word rustic. It's soft in texture, and combines unripe vegetable and mushroom flavors with sugary sweet raspberry jam.\",\n",

       " 'Earthy, loamy and raisiny on the nose, this blend of Cabernet and Syrah has an almost lazy mouthfeel braced by a shot of acidity. Earthy raspberry and blackberry flavors finish direct, with herbal notes. This is the epitome of a competent yet average wine.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely bursting with scents and flavors of ripe cherries, this delicious wine has amazing intensity. The fruit is as fresh as any wine can be, pure and focused, sweet and still deep, with a tight intensity that suggests good things to come. You have to love its purity.',\n",
       " \"There's no other wine like this in the world, and it won't appeal to everyone. Anfora is matured in ceramic amphorae for seven months in a throwback to ancient winemaking techniques to achieve a deep golden color and penetrating aromas of resin, caramel, chestnut honey and cola. The firmstructure could match that of a mature red and the wine imparts resinous, almost syrupy density.\",\n",
       " 'Some ripe honeydew melon, the merest hint of rose petals—this intriguing nose leads on to a plump, apple-fruited purity of palate around which notes of hazelnut play.

       " 'Notes of cola, black pepper and cocoa on the nose are followed by touches of red cherry, cedar and spice in this elegant red. It has a dry, sophisticated character but good red fruit roundness to balance the package.',\n",
       " \"Early on the wine is dominated by buttery oak, and it's all over the nose, palate and finish. Airing settles it down, and up from the creamy underworld comes raspberry, stewed plums and chocolate. Not the thinking man's Ribera del Duero, but it gets the job done. Imported by Freixenet, USA.\",\n",
       " \"Even among value-priced Cabs from Chile, this one isn't offering much. The nose is sharp and brambly, with a hint of stem that takes a while to loosen its grip. The palate is made up of bitter-tinged raspberry flavors and short, choppy tannins. Seems more short on substance than in the past.\",\n",
       " \"Savory, spicy aromas of leathery berry, oak and graphite set up a medium-full palate that's dense, blocky and burly. Dark, peppery flavors of plum and prune finish with a cool, herbal, minty sensation.\",\n",
       " \"Ten is Sea Smoke's biggest Pinot, a barrel selection chosen for sheer volume. It easily handles its 100% new oak coating. Needs decanting; even 15 minutes in the glass brought a unifying process, integrating the cedar and smoke with the explosive blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit, and revealing the rich, dense, satiny texture. Should age well for up to eight years.\",\n",
       " 'Cola, sasparilla, cherry blossoms, hard cherry candy and a hint of black currant hit the nose on this rich wine from Josh Jensen. The palate shows brown spice, with clove and peppercorns wrapping around a rhubarb-licorice-thyme character and tart cherries, making for an incredibly distinctive wine.',\n",
       " 'Solid and firm, it has powerful tannins and no sense yet of aging. The concentration is palpable, offering impressive weight while also bringing out ripe berry fruits. It needs until 2017–2018 to soften.',\n",
       " 'Grape growers since the end of the 18th century, the Dautel and Cadot families are based in the Aube area of Champagne. The family began making their own Champagne in 1971; now Sylvain Dautel works the vineyard by hand and makes the wine for this small maison. Full-bodied, this has touches of toast from the five years bottle age. The rich fruit also allows plenty of tight acidity into the mix. Drink this mature, well-balanced wine now.',\n",
       " 'Pencil lead and rubbery, mature berry aromas open this wine. The palate is driven by energetic, pounding tannins and flavors of black cherry and tomato, which become more prominent as the tannins and acid rebound. This is an indication of how Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon ages.',\n",

       " 'Tired red fruit lurks under the black-pepper and charred-oak flavors on the palate, though the woody, rustic mouthfeel is interesting. Nose is rather mute, with a little dried herb showing through.',\n",
       " \"Despite its robust body, there's a delicacy to pristine red cherry and cassis in this pretty Pinot Noir.

       " 'Tasted in a group of wines considerably more expensive, including from Napa Valley, this Cab stood out for its purity, balance and restraint. Really impresses for its structure, so nicely tannic and firm, and the way the currant, blackberry and cherry fruit flavors marry seamlessly with smoky oak. Represents a real step forward in Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon.',\n",
       " \"Starts off slowly, but opens considerably with air—so much so that it's probably worth decanting as you might a bottle of young white Burgundy. It's buttery and full, yet possesses a stony mineral quality that gives it balance. Initial peppery-spicy notes on the finish smooth out the longer it sits in the glass. Editors' Choice.\",\n",
       " \"Stewy, chewy and quite tannic this blend splits Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache into thirds. It offers little in the way of fruit; instead it's mostly leathery earth.\",\n",

       " \"So ripe and fruity, it's almost too much of a good thing. Detonates on the palate with blasts of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola and cinnamon spice. Feels too soft, and could use greater dryness and structure, but it's a good BBQ sipper.\",\n",

It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point.\",\n",

There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise.\",\n",
       " 'Some winemakers have a special feel for Pinot Noir, and Michael Stevenson, winemaker for Elizabeth Chambers, has earned a place among those select few. Previously known as Panther Creek, the winery has been re-branded and re-imagined under the current owners. This deliberate, controlled single vineyard effort punches through with a concentrated mix of plum, rhubarb and cherry fruit, showing exceptional grip, balance and length.',\n",
       " 'This shows real varietal character with spicy peaches-and-cream flavors and a nice vein of smoky oak, and a honeyed, crisp finish.',\n",
       " 'The sweetest style of Madeira still has that wonderful burnt acidity that keeps it from being cloying. So while there is an initial toffee character, the wine then tightens up with orange marmalade and an intense acidity. Drink this beautiful wine now.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of white spring flower, oak-driven vanilla and a whiff of white stone fruit lead the nose. The oak sensations follow through the somewhat lean palate, along with pear and a confectionery note. It closes on a note of bitter almond.',\n",
       " 'Made with organically farmed grapes, this simple, rustic rosato conveys aromas of red berry, game and a whiff of cellar must. The palate offers crushed wild cherry alongside zesty acidity.',\n",
       " 'While ripe on the nose with scents of juicy red cherries, mocha chocolate and Graham cracker crumbs, this soft, light-bodied Pinot Noir gains a slightly rustic edge on the midpalate with hints of fall foliage and a soft, furry coating of tannins on the finish.',\n",
       " \"While restrained on the nose, there's plenty of zesty apple, lemon and pear on the palate of this off-dry Riesling. It's an elegant yet quaffable wine with a brisk, crystalline finish. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Named after the stone blocks or menhirs which are a part of the Tannat vineyard, this a ripe, open and fruity wine. The Merlot does its job of softening the firm tannins of the Tannat and the blend gives a generous wine that has hints of the wood aging along with spice and acidity. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Ignore its generic Oregon AVA—this is King Estate's top wine, a rich reserve-level Pinot Noir redolent with Asian spices, saffron, cumin and more. Nuances of dusty cocoa powder lead into a thrilling wine with a spine of steel, focusing its ripe, fleshy fruit through a long, cellar-worthy finish.\",\n",
       " 'Raisin and baked plum aromas set the stage for a somewhat flat-feeling palate. Plum and berry aromas are chunky and finish soft, with low acidity and not a lot of pop.',\n",
       " 'Hints of sweet pastry introduce this bright, summery Merlot sparkling. Fun and fizzy, it fills the palate with rich, creamy mousse and sweet-tart strawberry-yogurt flavor.',\n",
       " 'Best on the nose, but sharp and narrow as can be on the palate. Cranberry and sour cherry flavors dominate, while the finish is astringent. No amount of swirling and saving is going help it much.',\n",
       " 'Crisp and fresh aromas of lime sorbet and iced apple flesh greet the nose on this Riboli family bottling. The palate is steely and bright, with Anjou pear flesh, a bit of smoke and some red-apple ripeness.',\n",
