    "### Machine Learning using NLP of Wine Descriptions\n",
    "**Goal:** perform NLP on wine descriptions (using TF-IDF). Use the TF-IDF scores, along with other wine info, to build a machine learning algorithm that can predict the rating score for wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  A csv file of reviews with descripitons, varietals, region, and score from Wine Enthusiast Magazine. CSV was obtained from use zackthoutt on kaggle.com: [wine review data](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). This dataset is 150,000 wine reviews, and only includes wines with scores from 80-100.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:** A machine learnign algorithm that can take in:\n",
    "1. Wine description (textual)\n",
    "2. Country of origin\n",
    "3. Designation (optional) - this is more specific data about the wine\n",
    "4. Price\n",
    "5. Province (optional)\n",
    "6. Region\n",
    "7. Varietal\n",
    "8. Winery\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm should then output a score (from 80-100).\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we will create an algorithm that will attempt to predict score from *only* the text description, and will then compare this to an ML algorithm including text data in addition to the other wine data."
